    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While recording a video course you constantly need to put your environment in the same state and you often repeat the same action. Having a few keyboard shortcuts up your sleeve can make your life a lot easier. Here is some keyboard shortcuts that I found useful while recording the <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/web-development-nodejs-and-mongodb-video">Web Development with Node.JS and MongoDB</a> video course.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that my local environment is OSX, so shortcuts and applications are based for it. Not all shortcuts are set by default (for example I set them myself for Screenflow).</p>

<p>Skip to any of the sections or continue reading:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#full-screen">Full screen</a></li>
<li><a href="#screenshots">Screenshots</a></li>
<li><a href="#finder">Finder</a></li>
<li><a href="#chrome">Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="#sublime-text">Sublime Text</a></li>
<li><a href="#iterm">iTerm</a></li>
<li><a href="#screenflow">Screenflow</a></li>
<li><a href="#resolution">Recording resolution</a></li>
<li><a href="#display-mirroring">Quick display mirroring</a></li>
</ul>


<p><a name="full-screen"></a></p>

<h2>Full screen</h2>

<p>Note that for most of applications <code>⌃⌘F</code> will put them in full screen mode.</p>

<p><a name="screenshots"></a></p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<p>The <code>⇧⌘3</code> (<em>whole screen</em>) and <code>⇧⌘4</code> (<em>selected area</em>) was really helpful for taking screenshots. The screenshots were later used inside the scripts, slides, or videos. <strong>Use the mouse</strong> when taking area screenshots for the scripts. If you don&rsquo;t have one, spend a few bucks for a cheap one. It will be much faster and less painful.</p>

<p><a name="finder"></a></p>

<h2>Finder</h2>

<p>You will probably end managing a lot of files. Finder might not be the best application for managing files, but it&rsquo;s perfectly fine once I learned how to do <strong>copy/paste</strong>. This was a life saver and saved me from using the mouse for file manipulations.</p>

<p><code>⌘C</code> => Cut</p>

<p><code>⌥⌘V</code> => Paste</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s mostly fine to use the default Finder. Though, depending on your set up you might want to make a few changes.</p>

<p><code>⌥⌘P</code> => Hide path bar</p>

<p><code>⌥⌘S</code> => Hide sidebar</p>

<p><code>⌥⌘T</code> => Hide toolbar</p>

<p><a name="chrome"></a></p>

<h2>Chrome</h2>

<p>For my most day to day I use FireFox. Chrome is used for additional testing and video watching (plays most videos without needing Flash). I chose Chrome as my default browser for the course for a single reason. <em>FireFox doesn&rsquo;t have a shortcut to hide bookmarks toolbar</em>. Just didn&rsquo;t feel like constantly going through menus using a mouse to hide/show it.</p>

<p><code>⇧⌘B</code> => Hide bookmarks bar</p>

<p>While doing another video experiment started to notice how problematic bookmarks toolbar is on FireFox, but found one solution for easy hiding. By using <a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/menu-bar-search">Menu Bar Search Workflow for Alfred</a>, it&rsquo;s possible to hide/show it using only the keyboard. Still not as easy as using a shortcut.</p>

<p><a name="sublime-text"></a></p>

<h2>Sublime Text</h2>

<p>If you do other work with the editor while recording, keeping the font size at <code>16px</code> is not the best choice (depends on preference / quality of eyes). You will want to constantly change the font size depending on the work you do.</p>

<p><code>⌘+</code> => Increase font size</p>

<p><code>⌘-</code> => Decrease font size</p>

<p><a name="iterm"></a></p>

<h2>iTerm</h2>

<p>For the course related terminal I had a new window that run a dedicated profile on a few tabs. That way they didn&rsquo;t get in the way, and didn&rsquo;t need any changes (like making font size bigger).</p>

<p>The iTerm has a different shortcut for a full screen (<code>⌘⏎</code>).</p>

<p>Sometimes something messed up and the terminal was not recorded. In that case turning full screen off and on fixed the problem. This mostly happened on the next day (after a lot of putting laptop to sleep and similar activities).</p>

<p>Another very useful shortcut was <code>⌃L</code> for clearing the terminal window. Unlike <code>⌘K</code> (clear buffer) shortcut, this command re-loads the prompt too.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more useful iTerm shortcuts read <a href="/iterm-shortcut-keys">iTerm Shortcut Keys</a> article.</p>

<p><a name="screenflow"></a></p>

<h2>Screenflow</h2>

<p>Screenflow is a great application for recording and editing your videos. It takes some time to get used to. After a while you make your own workflow and get good at it.</p>

<p><code>⌃⌥⌘R</code> => Record; for starting new a recording and stopping an existing one</p>

<p><code>⌃⌥⌘P</code> => Pause; for pausing a recording, didn&rsquo;t use often as most of recordings was done in short clips (also very long recording are harder to manage/edit)</p>

<p><code>⌃⌥⌘M</code> => Mark; for adding a marker on the recording. Useful for longer recordings. Comes in handy to mark the places you need to edit (like to cut out a part of it)</p>

<p><code>⌥⌘N</code> => Nest clips; would depend on your chosen workflow. As I chose to do everything in small clips (slides), each of them was made from multiple videos/images/audio, and then nested into a single clip for easier maintenance.</p>

<p><a name="resolution"></a></p>

<h2>Recording resolution</h2>

<p>When recording your videos you might want to set your screen resolution to <code>1280x720</code> or an equivalent of it (e.g., at <code>2560x1440</code> for retina display). That way you get a nice HD quality videos without any cropping or similar artifacts (an would guess that exporting is faster).</p>

<p>To change the resolution I used the <a href="https://github.com/ramiroaraujo/alfred-set-resolution-workflow">Set Resolution Workflow for Alfred</a>. Press <code>⌥SPACE</code> (my preference for opening Alfred), enter <code>setresolution</code> (using tab key autocomplete it after a few letters), enter <code>720</code>, and choose the resolution you want. After finishing switch back.</p>

<p><a name="display-mirroring"></a></p>

<h2>Quick display mirroring</h2>

<p>I use the external monitor in my daily life. Normally the laptop is in front (for keyboard and touchpad), with mirroring turned on, and laptop brightness all the way down (only single display used). For recording, having two displays is very useful. You can record on one and have all the notes on another.</p>

<p>Normally it would mean going to <code>System Preferences -&gt; Displays -&gt; Arrangement -&gt; Mirror Displays</code>. That takes a lot of time and a lot of mouse maneuvering.</p>

<p>Oh, how happy I was then I found you can do this with <code>⌘F1</code> (actually it&rsquo;s <code>⌘BrightnessDown</code>). This will turn display mirroring on and off.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you use Mac OSX and do a lot of work in terminal the <a href="https://www.iterm2.com">iTerm</a> application will become your friend fast. It&rsquo;s a great terminal application and it would be hard to imagine my days without it.</p>

<p>Once you learn a few shortcut keys and develop your personal work flow you would hardly want to leave that black (differs) window.</p>

<p>Below is some of the shortcut keys I use.</p>

<h2>Working with multiple terminals</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s rare occasion having only one terminal open as often I&rsquo;m working with multiple projects / tools at the same time. Sometimes even if I&rsquo;m not using something at the moment (or in the last few days / weeks) the terminal windows are left as is (often to avoid going to the needed directory). And sometimes you just need to try something fast and close it. Following shortcuts allow me to open new terminals, move between them, close once I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>

<blockquote><p>New Tab <code>⌘T</code></p>

<p>Previous Tab <code>⌘←</code></p>

<p>Next Tab <code>⌘→</code></p>

<p>Close tab <code>⌘w</code></p></blockquote>

<p>You could move the tabs around using the following shortcut keys, but I rarely use them.</p>

<blockquote><p>Move Tab Right <code>⇧⌘→</code></p>

<p>Move Tab Left <code>⇧⌘←</code></p></blockquote>

<h2>Working with multiple terminals in same tab</h2>

<p>Opening a new tab takes care of the most use cases, but sometimes there&rsquo;s a need to see multiple terminals at the same time. The splitting the tab shortcut keys are the lifesaver in those moments. You can go crazy with splitting the current tab (if you need to)!</p>

<blockquote><p>Split Vertically with Current Profile <code>⌘D</code></p>

<p>Split Horizontally with Current Profile <code>⇧⌘D</code></p></blockquote>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/22596362330/in/dateposted-public/" title="iterm-split-windows-go-crazy"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5658/22596362330_9a8d2fabed_c.jpg" width="733" height="800" alt="iterm-split-windows-go-crazy"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Your performance would suffer a lot if you had to use the mouse to use any of those terminals. For that problem the shortcut keys to move between the panes solve it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Next Pane <code>⌘]</code></p>

<p>Previous Pane <code>⌘[</code></p></blockquote>

<p>You can also move between panes directionally. Most of the time I can&rsquo;t remember the shortcut keys for it, previous/next pane works great, rarely have more than 2 panes at the time.</p>

<blockquote><p>Select Pane Above <code>⌥⌘↑</code></p>

<p>Select Pane Below <code>⌥⌘↓</code></p>

<p>Select Pane Left <code>⌥⌘←</code></p>

<p>Select Pane Right <code>⌥⌘→</code></p></blockquote>

<h2>Interacting with the terminal</h2>

<p>The following shortcut keys are not used that often (sometimes due to failing personal memory). They do come in handy from time to time when you need to do something with the output which is in terminal.</p>

<blockquote><p>Clear Window <code>⌃L</code></p>

<p>Clear Buffer <code>⌘K</code></p>

<p>Scroll Up <code>⇧Page Up</code></p>

<p>Scroll Down <code>⇧Page Down</code></p>

<p>Find&hellip; <code>⌘F</code></p></blockquote>

<h2>Changing font size</h2>

<p>The iTerm on my machine is configured to my liking and works for almost all the use cases. For that reason it&rsquo;s rare to change the font size. If you&rsquo;re making a presentation, recording screen cast or your eyes are tired shortcut keys for changing font size solves that problem.</p>

<blockquote><p>Make Text Bigger <code>⌘+</code></p>

<p>Make Text Normal Size <code>⌘0</code></p>

<p>Make Text Smaller <code>⌘-</code></p></blockquote>

<h2>Custom shortcuts keys</h2>

<p>You can change global shortcut keys from profile preferences <code>Keys</code> tab. One shortcut key I find useful is deleting the last word. It uses the <code>⌘←Delete</code> as keyboard shortcut and sends the <code>0x1B 0x08</code> hex code (action).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/22841825873/in/dateposted-public/" title="iterm-custom-shortcut-key"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/597/22841825873_9521a2502d_c.jpg" width="800" height="464" alt="iterm-custom-shortcut-key"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<blockquote><p>Go Left One Word <code>⌥←</code> (send escape sequence <code>b</code>)</p>

<p>Go Right One Word <code>⌥→</code> (send escape sequence <code>f</code>)</p></blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>These are the shortcut keys I use daily with iTerm. Learning shortcut keys for any application can move you to a power user level and improve your productivity a lot. The problem is remembering all of them.</p>
