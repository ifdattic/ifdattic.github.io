    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After purchasing the tickets to a SymfonyCon in Madrid I decided it would be great way to explore Spain. In Lithuania during that time weather gets colder so this will let me enjoy summer for a bit longer. My trip was supposed to be from October 23rd to December 9th. Maybe not the warmest months in Spain, but for someone who doesn&rsquo;t enjoy when it&rsquo;s very hot it looked like it will be a pleasantly warm trip.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24182297796/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="2014-spain-cover"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1675/24182297796_34b637327f_c.jpg" width="800" height="400" alt="2014-spain-cover"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Some might wonder why it was &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to be during that time range. The reason is simple with two great lessons for traveling: <strong>don&rsquo;t oversleep your flight</strong> and <strong>adapt</strong>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24100061032/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="3"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1581/24100061032_55b0332923_c.jpg" width="450" height="800" alt="3"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Actually, I wasn&rsquo;t surprised when this happened as the beginning of the trip wasn&rsquo;t going so well. Almost forgot my passport and almost got into head-on car crash. And I knew I will have to learn this lesson sooner or latter. For people who might be thinking &ldquo;<em>what an idiot, oversleeping a flight after setting up 10 different alarms</em>,&rdquo; I completely agree with you. Just not much to do when you set it for PM, not AM. But you can be damn sure I won&rsquo;t allow this to happen again anytime soon. Now I&rsquo;m too paranoid and have multiple systems in place.</p>

<p>You would also want to adapt quickly to situations and react with a cool head. I won&rsquo;t lie, I had thought about just dropping the whole thing and going back home where it&rsquo;s safe and relaxing. <em>You can&rsquo;t succeed without failing</em>. Half an hour later I had bought new tickets, canceled the reservations I won&rsquo;t be able to take, booked new places to stay at and ready to go for a chilly morning walk to freshen my head. It might have added an extra expense of $1000, but I always laugh remembering it, while the people who hear it are recovering from the shock.</p>

<p>After a long 3 hours flight and enjoying a wonderful sunrise I&rsquo;m in Barcelona ready to be overwhelmed by new experiences. It&rsquo;s an early morning. Streets are almost empty and it&rsquo;s something indescribable to see palms and enormous buildings for the first time. Unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t last for long as palms get filtered out just like ordinary street posts. Streets are dirty like everywhere else (cans, cigarette buts, etc.) and the buildings just give a feeling like they are trying to measure who has a bigger one (you know what).</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s not everyday you travel hundreds of miles to a completely different country, and I&rsquo;m grateful for that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last day the weather was getting better and I thought about visiting a few other places I had on the list. Until I understood that I reached that point where I don&rsquo;t care anymore about the journey and just want to reach the destination. No point in getting over the head just to put another check mark on the list. Spent the rest of the day in the park, sitting &amp; relaxing until it was time to leave Amsterdam.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/23142641809" title="10495853_10202339209902188_6895619919232677953_o"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5756/23142641809_0d6602204c_c.jpg" width="800" height="400" alt="10495853_10202339209902188_6895619919232677953_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Unfortunately my journey got a little longer than I wanted. I think right after I bought the train ticket (I would have been told before buying if there were issues), something happened to the power lines (from what I was able to find out later) and the line between Amsterdam-Eindhoven was closed. At that time I didn&rsquo;t had a lot of experience riding trains and every information was in Dutch. Was walking around trying to figure out which train I should take and starting to get a feeling something is wrong. Got into one train, but my gut started to tell I should get out. After some time asked an employee which train is to Eindhoven and she told I have to get on that train (by pointing), go to Rotterdam and then go to Eindhoven.</p>

<p>Something was definitely wrong. I got in a full train and started browsing internet to see how my plans are changing. It looked like my 1.5 hours Amsterdam-Eindhoven trip in best case will be 1.5 hours Amsterdam-Rotterdam, wait for 30-60 minutes, 1.5 hours Rotterdam-Eindhoven. Crap. Oh well, not like I can change anything. Sit down and try to relax, you still have a long trip left.</p>

<p>A much longer trip than I expected. Towards the end I started to notice that the train might not go to main train station. Maybe I was wrong, but it looked like at one point it will start going in opposite direction and the last time I waited I ended up in an airport not a city center. It was time to make a decision and I chose to get out and walk the rest of the way (if I was right it would be a shorter walk than going all the way).</p>

<p>I was in a middle of nowhere and had about 30 minutes to walk 10 kilometers. If I was late I will need to wait about an hour for the next train which would also take longer than 1.5 hours to reach the Eindhoven. This trip got long enough so no thank you. At this point I was very happy about traveling alone and only with a backpack. Started looking at the map and taking long fast strides to get a chance to reach a train station on time. Looking for fastest way led me through roads, fields, shady neighborhoods, etc. Didn&rsquo;t care. Just kept on walking from time to time letting out a curse word and motivating myself with &ldquo;if you gonna be late I will punch you in the face, hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After I got the train station in my view it felt great and I was still on time. Of course waiting in the line to buy the ticket, seeing how slowly it was moving and how fast the watch arrow turned was nerving. Was able to buy the tickets, go to the WC and wait on platform one minute before the train arrived. Sat down, relaxed. All that was left was a 1.5 hours train ride and my journey is done.</p>

<p>Or so I thought. Contacted my airbnb host that I will arrive in a few hours and come to him after I got a glass of cold beer somewhere to relax my nerves. My host suggested that I won&rsquo;t take too long as a big storm (supposedly) will start at around 11PM. I thanked him for the warning, the day was already long without any extra surprises.</p>

<p>After leaving the train I bought a can of beer at the train station shop. The day was long enough without having to go to some noisy bar. 8 minutes of walk to the place of my stay for the night and this long day would be done. I left the train station, walking towards the traffic lights and after a few meters the rain starts drizzling. Nothing what would be bad for 8 minutes, but just in case I put on my jacket. After few more meters the rain starts pouring in buckets. Fuck! Spent the next 8 minutes sprinting and looking for non existent places to hide from the rain.</p>

<p>The host opens the doors and I&rsquo;m standing dripping water only with my underwear dry (so not the worst walk in the rain I had). He shows me around the place and at first I go to the shower. After which I&rsquo;m starting to feel like a human again. Open a can of beer and work for half an hour; just needed something to do where I would be in control.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/16898784814/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10483184_10202339208222146_4097043738260715951_o"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8694/16898784814_3cddbf26de_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="10483184_10202339208222146_4097043738260715951_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My room was in a 11th floor and in something that I would call a glass balcony. With a thunderstorm going outside at least I slept very well (rain, thunder, turbulence relaxes me &amp; helps me sleep). The next morning I took the bus to airport. Of course the ticket machine takes no paper money &amp; who the hell has coins (they are heavy). After going through all the bus and exchanging 5 euros in paper to about 3 euros in coins (didn&rsquo;t care anymore, just needed the ticket) I reached an airport.</p>

<p>While boarding the plane the hostess suggested that maybe I would like to take the exit row seat. My first thought &ndash; oh great, gonna get lost one more time, well at least I will have enough room for my legs until we crash. I sit down, turn on vocals chill-out music &amp; try to relax. Towards the landing the turbulence starts to pick up helping me to relax and add panic for others. When the following lyrics come up &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m falling down, I&rsquo;m falling fast.</em>&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not making this up, this would be too stupid to make up. I take report of my surroundings &ndash; had a fresh drink of water, nice music is playing in my head, sitting comfortably &ndash; screw it, we can crash, I&rsquo;m feeling happy now. Still couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from starting to chuckle from this situation. Which I find from side view might have looked a little disturbing. Well, we landed safely and this was the end of the trip.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would like to live in Amsterdam/Netherlands. If I started to drink &amp; smoke it might have extra points about living there, but still wouldn&rsquo;t sell me so easy on long term living. But after some time I noticed that I do like Amsterdam. It&rsquo;s a wonderful place &amp; walking around it for a week or few makes me happy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to visit the Hortus Botanicus and Natura Artis Magistra before leaving. Unfortunately the last few days of my stay was rainy and walking around in the rain didn&rsquo;t feel like an exciting way to spend time. The rain let down a little bit giving me chance to visit the zoo. At first I was thinking about skipping it. I seen animals in the cage before so it won&rsquo;t be anything interesting. This is what I thought, but I&rsquo;m glad I just did it anyway. The ticket isn&rsquo;t cheap, but for the value you get it&rsquo;s worth it. After buying the ticket was asked if I would like to buy the map and the money spent for it will be used to improve the elephant section. I try to avoid extras like guided tours, audio tours, etc., but elephants never did anything bad to me so why not, let&rsquo;s help the little guys/gals. The map doesn&rsquo;t hurt as the place is enormous.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed is that animals are actually not in the cages. So you better behave as there is not a lot of protection between getting your ass kicked. Seeing camels walking around with a bunch of other animals and being separated only by a narrow line of water looks awesome, disturbing, relaxing. All at the same time. Walking by them is like walking through a bad neighborhood, you try to look like you belong there and are ready to run just in case. Walking past the birds gives a different reaction. It&rsquo;s all in my head, but I just wanted to run to them, start making motions from ground to air with my hands and shouting &ldquo;<em>Fly you fools!! Freedom, fly to freedom!!</em>&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure if they could talk, their reaction to this would be &ldquo;<em>Go eF yourself!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>After calming myself down started to wander around the zoo, looking at animals, reading about them and just having good time. Too bad the tigers (I think) habitat was closed for renovations. Walked past the cages with parrots. I do dislike them. They are just too noisy for my taste. Around that time the rain started to pick up again. Fortunately I just reached the aquarium part of the zoo giving me shelter from it.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17519025602/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10550111_10202330518924919_6303576271895424654_o"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8754/17519025602_ac7e0f45d7_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="10550111_10202330518924919_6303576271895424654_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The aquarium is nice with lots of colors. Got into an eye staring contest with a blue frog (wanted to find out if she&rsquo;s real or not). Until noticed that I got surrounded by a bunch of her friends and it was time for me to leave. You can see a bunch of strange fishes, some of which makes you think about against getting a diver&rsquo;s license. Just too many things which got away from the horror movie and would eat you.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17495048186/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10428183_10202330521404981_5355992987067705238_o"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7775/17495048186_36c9b0ab05_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="10428183_10202330521404981_5355992987067705238_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After wandering around the zoo for a little longer found the terrarium with spiders &amp; snakes &amp; other cute lovely pets. It would be great to visit them during the feeding time. Or if they would let you pet them (I&rsquo;m against that as it would be too much stress for the poor animal, but I just always like touching &amp; biting new/interesting things).</p>

<p>You start understanding they don&rsquo;t care too much about cages when you reach one of the &ldquo;inclusive areas&rdquo; you can travel through. The first one for me was the butterflies habitat. It&rsquo;s something like a small patch of a tropical forest you can walk around with butterflies flying all around you. In some places where there food for them and you could take a closer look. So far I can&rsquo;t compare it, but it was the first time experience on how the tropical forest might feel &amp; I liked to get that under my belt. Thanks to my imagination I was also expecting a velociraptor to run past me, but I guess you can&rsquo;t get everything you want. *Side note: After a year I visited Hortus Botanicus which allows you to experience different climate zones, still no velociraptors :(*</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17519020132/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10551528_10202330524125049_746054191702381928_o"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5460/17519020132_a1ea28907a_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="10551528_10202330524125049_746054191702381928_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Another open area where you can get closer to animals was the lemur patch. You can walk right past them and maybe get a massage if you sit down (maybe if you forgot to see the bite signs). They look cute enough, but I didn&rsquo;t trust them enough for that. Was nice to learn that they have hands similar to human hands, with fingers and everything. You live and learn. They can scream loud too.</p>

<p>Walking around found the wolf&rsquo;s habitat. Don&rsquo;t know why, but I adore them. Maybe because I met a wolf while walking alone in the forest when I was about 5-7 years old. Maybe for some other reason. I do find them beautiful &amp; royal animals. Too bad due to rain or other reasons it was hard to have a closer look at them.</p>

<p>After a while I reached a tropical house (I think it&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s called). The signs about not letting out the animals and getting bitten didn&rsquo;t made me comfortable. If it wasn&rsquo;t safe they won&rsquo;t be allowing you to enter and with this thought I entered the house. I slowly started going in deeper, looking around to make sure no one attacks me by surprise and still not sure if I&rsquo;m allowed in here.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17521337305/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10497313_10202330523645037_7410082079628888463_o"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8835/17521337305_6df8a106c6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="10497313_10202330523645037_7410082079628888463_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There is two categories of animals I &ldquo;fear&rdquo; &ndash; rodents (rats, mice, etc.) &amp; amphibians (frogs, etc.). I&rsquo;m not sure why. I just don&rsquo;t like them. Even in the toy shop I will walk around them. I include (included actually from then) bats to the same category thinking of them as flying rats. When I was about in the middle of the house from the other part of it the bat started flying into me, flew past me, turned around and flew past me again. At that moment I was crouching on the floor with my hands on my head, not sure what I should do.</p>

<p>The zoo employees who were sitting and talking told me it&rsquo;s safe and I don&rsquo;t need to be afraid of them. Easy for you to say, I don&rsquo;t see monsters flying past your head (all in my head, enchanted by wicked imagination). We started talking and she took me to the tree where the bat was eating. Once you get close enough to punch them in the face they are actually cute monsters.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17333556728/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10494995_10202330525205076_2228704594717199738_o"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5442/17333556728_e295b0927f_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="10494995_10202330525205076_2228704594717199738_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>She helped me to find all the animals what are in the house and their stories. The big lizards and the small lizards. The monkeys, how one of them has a broken tail and another one just had a baby. That squirrel animal from Ice Age movie. We also talked about the zoo itself. Was nice to chat with her and at the end I was comfortable staying in that house. Still being alert to do a karate chop in case someone attacked. I know, I&rsquo;m paranoid.</p>

<p>I put my nose inside the birds house (which was adjacent). I&rsquo;m not a big fan of birds (they are too noisy for me) &amp; I didn&rsquo;t want to get bombarded by crap so turned around and left.</p>

<p>The zoo was close to closing time so I chose to go past the water birds habitat which ends near exit. For someone who can&rsquo;t (probably) swim and being surrounded by birds which looks like drug dealers it wasn&rsquo;t very comfortable walking through a narrow metal bridge (without anything to hang on). But it&rsquo;s a new experience.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17519040952/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10541062_10202330522805016_403624763809583833_o"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5468/17519040952_daa1a41dea_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="10541062_10202330522805016_403624763809583833_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t listen to the voice in my head (something I should do more often) and went to the zoo. It was a surprise and a new experience to walk so close to animals not in cages. If you get a chance I would suggest to check it out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Amsterdam also has an Ice Bar. The ticket includes a drink in the normal bar. When time for another group comes you see an instructional video, put on some special clothes and enter I would say a medium sized freezer. It contains a bar made from ice and a few ice sculptures, nothing fancy. You can get two drinks which is either beer or vodka with juice (or without). As you can get only one glass the host suggests to choose your first drink wisely as you might end drinking beer from a shot glass. Glasses are also made from ice. You have big gloves, but make sure you&rsquo;re holding it tightly as a lot of them end up on the ground. Even thought the jacket keeps you warm enough I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest shoes with thin soles, your feet will get freezing fast. Or at least don&rsquo;t stop moving. I found this a pleasant experience and if you drink it&rsquo;s worth a visit. Barcelona also has the Ice bar by the beach and would have visited it again except I wasn&rsquo;t drinking anymore at that time.</p>

<p>As for the Heineken factory museum I would suggest to skip it. Unless you&rsquo;re some college student which finds things like this interesting. I had my doubts about visiting it, but while walking past it decided what why not, maybe it will have something fun. What a waste of money &amp; time. The big part of it is commercials related material or some crappy touristy things. It has some learning elements about how the beer is made, but they are not that interesting to catch your attention. At one point there is some kind of a ride which might be fun except what you would need to wait at least 20 minutes for it so you just skip it. At the end you can choose if you want to get two glasses of beer or one which you can pour yourself (which also has an enormous line). I disliked this one and recommending to skip it. Rather go spend that money to visit <a href="/amsterdam-dungeon">Amsterdam Dungeon</a> for the second time.</p>

<p>You can also find Torture Museum in Amsterdam. It isn&rsquo;t expensive so if you have nothing better to do you might want to visit it. Most of the time you&rsquo;re just walking through badly lid corridors checking out some torturing instruments and reading info about them. Other than a few strange/painful torture devices there isn&rsquo;t much to do in this one.</p>

<p>I also visited a Jews Museum, more or less because I was walking past it. It&rsquo;s a nice museum. I&rsquo;m just not emotionally invested in what it has to offer for it to be of much interest. If you&rsquo;re a Jew or connected to this topic I&rsquo;m sure you would find it interesting. Choose yourself.</p>

<p>Farther away from the city center you can find the Tropenmuseum. Take the lift to the top floor and start exploring it. I would say it&rsquo;s an interesting museum and allows you to get some basic knowledge about cultures from around the world. From amazon tribes to American sixties. It allows you to get a feeling how it might felt to be in some pop cafe or inside a hut. It was a relaxing place to visit and my suggestion would be to check it out.</p>

<p>Near the NEMO science center is the maritime museum which isn&rsquo;t that easy to miss due to a big ship outside it. As in most places you will be asked to put your bag in the locker which in here is a bit trickier than in most places were you give it to someone or get a key for locker. This one is higher tech, but as long as you follow the instructions you should be fine. The building has many wings which has different expositions. Can&rsquo;t remember them all, but some of things which you will see is history of slavery and lot of ship models. I found that just wondering around felt relaxing as this place had a nice &ldquo;aura.&rdquo; The ship is a little modified replica of some real ship. Below deck you will find storage space and living quarters. Don&rsquo;t forget to jump into one of hammocks and let your legs rest for a minute. I could also say that the ship wasn&rsquo;t made for tall people so watch your head! Above deck you find living quarters of a captain, the kitchen, steering wheel (you can tell I&rsquo;m not an expert on ships). All in all I wouldn&rsquo;t say that museum has something out of ordinary to show, but I found it relaxing and suggest to visit it. Also if you would look at the ceiling you might see the cousin of WALL-E cleaning the windows.</p>

<p>Of course you can&rsquo;t talk about Amsterdam without mentioning Red Light District. Skip the rest of the article if this topic is not acceptable to you.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so integrated into the city center that you will probably pass it even by accident. You should watch out were you&rsquo;re walking as sometimes you might get blinded by a nice pair and have an accident. If you came to Amsterdam for bodily pleasure there are enough choices to find something you like. I personally look at all this RLD like an equivalent of fast food restaurant: get in, get out, vomit around the corner. No, I&rsquo;m not against prostitution and just like prostitutes my stance is what it should be legal everywhere. I just look at sex in a different perspective and RLD approach is not for me. If you didn&rsquo;t come to visit red or blue lights, you will soon start filtering out all the knocks and invitations.</p>

<p>If you walk around the church you might notice a pair of breasts on the ground. On internet it&rsquo;s made much more exciting, in reality it&rsquo;s &ndash; meh. From the smell you might also notice that RLD has a lot of coffee shops. I always liked the look and smell of cannabis plant, but now the smell makes me nauseous and had to do some navigation to avoid it. RLD is beautiful and has a different feel after sun down. Of course you hear a lot more of &ldquo;pssst, cocaine?&rdquo; Just keep on walking.</p>

<p>I would suggest to visit the prostitution museum. Especially if you think it&rsquo;s a joke and if you&rsquo;re paying for these services you can be an ass and do whatever you want. If you&rsquo;re on the next side of scales where you think prostitution is an abomination, should be banned and punished you should also visit and maybe learn a thing or two. Wondering what is my view on this topic? In my opinion every one of us is a prostitute, the only difference is only which part of yourself you&rsquo;re selling. Just try to be a decent human being and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>You will find Hash &amp; Hemp museum in RLD. It doesn&rsquo;t have anything very exciting, but it&rsquo;s a nice museum to visit. For a few euros you get a chance to see some artifacts from the old days. If you have time to spend I think it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/16898968414/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="616541_10202287386206628_588367605791041677_o"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7776/16898968414_c727a355a4_z.jpg" width="607" height="640" alt="616541_10202287386206628_588367605791041677_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>RLD has a few establishments providing live shows. The best choice would be Casa Rosso Theater or it&rsquo;s the one I visited. It&rsquo;s not cheap at about €50 with two drinks, but in my opinion worth the experience. You enter something that looks like a small cinema/theater with seats split into two sections. Right section is for groups (from that I understood) containing noisy teenagers who already had a little too much to drink. The left side contains walk-ins ranging from normal looking people to some shady looking people in raincoats. Once in a while the waiters walk in bringing the drinks and taking the orders for drinks. I guess the place has to look the part and if I had to describe how the waiters looked like I would say take someone from 60&rsquo;s or 80&rsquo;s porn movies (I still have no idea how it should look, but it&rsquo;s the thought which comes to mind). The shows have a mix of a girl playing with herself, a pair having fun, strip with someone from the audience, games with audience participation. If you want to take part in the show avoid being a walk-in. Learned that I was right about Rammstein music being good for &ldquo;making love.&rdquo; Also that I should start exercising. A nice experience to put under your belt if you have €50 to spend and want a few giggles.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The most enjoyable place I visited was the Amsterdam Dungeon, oh it was amazing. My suggestion would be just to find when the next play is and come a bit before that time. Even though it&rsquo;s funny to listen to the ghost in the cage, he starts repeating after a while and it&rsquo;s too loud to have a normal conversation with other prisoners. I would try to not disclose too much information about it (spoilers). I will have to write about some fun moments I had in there. This also contains some gruesome parts so you might want to skip it if it&rsquo;s not your thing. Warning provided, let the fun begin.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At first the group was split and I was expecting some cheap thrills, like a skeleton dropping out of the ceiling or something like that. After an elevator ride down you&rsquo;re some place looking like a torture dungeon. Some animatronics, spiked chair and stuff like that. Well if this is it then it will be boring, very boring. After a few minutes the sound of dragging chain begins and the door opens. I would say the actors are professional and react well to all the small problems. I feel a little bad about them because hearing them &ldquo;talk loudly / scream&rdquo; my own throat starts hurting; well they are probably used to it.</p>

<p>I take the front row seat. One from the group is chosen to be tortured and after some acting the lights go out. The voice starts praying in random places. Some screams from the group in random places and then something happened which made me thing &ldquo;OK, this might be fun after all.&rdquo; To better know why I liked this attraction is what I feel refreshed by &ldquo;seeing fear in other people eyes.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t imagine me as some kind of monster who runs down the street with a chainsaw after the sun goes down; just for some reason it makes me smile and refreshed. OK, I&rsquo;m not explaining this well, fine, just imagine me running down the street with a chainsaw, brrrm brrrrm brrrrrrrrrrrrrrmmmmmm. It&rsquo;s all fun and games until someone loses the hand :D</p>

<p>After this one we went to a tavern, learning some history, getting few simple scares, etc. The tavern wench warned about not trusting anyone as sailors end up in ships because they wrote their name selling their soul. Then one from the group was asked to come and write his name. Which he did (oh come on, weren&rsquo;t you listening about not trusting anyone and not writing your name). Then she displays that he was tricked and now he will be going to work in the ship. But here&rsquo;s your chance to save your soul and if you open not a skull picture from three choices you will be free. Otherwise everyone will be going to the ship. Oh come on, this one is easy, you choose one, tell to open the other two and win, but no.. She mixes the choices, he chooses one of them, it&rsquo;s the skull and everyone is going to a ship.</p>

<p>The next room is below the ship deck and the pirate is explaining her life story, what a tasty soup rats make and choosing the jobs for everyone. Then she points at me and says &ldquo;You, come here. What is your name?&rdquo;. Me &ldquo;Andrew&rdquo;. She &ldquo;Who cares, from now on your name will be Bobby. You can&rsquo;t trust anyone on this ship, especially the traitors. Now, everyone point a finger at Bobby and shout TRAITOR!!!&rdquo;. A few people point their fingers and very silently and timidly start saying &ldquo;Traitor.&rdquo; At this point I was sure I will be having as much fun from this attraction as possible. I start lifting my hands in encouragement and shout &ldquo;Oh come on, you can do better!!&rdquo; Now everyone reacts a little better, still a little too much zombie like for my liking. The pirate gives me a rag and tells from now on my job is to clean the cannons and points to one of them. I start shining it off and soon enough it shoots. &ldquo;What have you done?! I told you to clean the cannon, not to shoot it!&rdquo; &ldquo;Premature detonation, it happens, it&rsquo;s not my fault!&rdquo; &ldquo;Give me back the rag!&rdquo; &ldquo;NO!!&rdquo; at this point we had a short discussion about who will keep the rag. She explains that as Bobby is the traitor he has to be tortured and puts me on the chair with a white sheet in front of me. When she asks something and strikes the hammer behind my head. I would guess that everyone else at that point was enjoying a nice splash of my brain on the front of the sheet. Then she does the same thing again. Then tells me to open my legs wide. Attractions like this are just like jumping with parachute. They are made to be safe as it&rsquo;s bad marketing when something happens to customers, but you never know that might happen *splash*. Lets just say I looked her in the eyes which said &ldquo;You better not F***ing miss,&rdquo; I might not care about my balls, but I don&rsquo;t feel like acting as a snake for the rest of the day. She hits between my legs, a cannon shoots and lets just say something happens, everyone has to abandon the ship. She takes everyone to the exit, explaining what to do. Due to my personally I choose not to stay at my current place, just get up and casually start leaving the ship. The pirate returns, notices I&rsquo;m gone, stays confused for a few seconds, then runs back to the exit and shouts &ldquo;If you will see Bobby on the shore.. Kill him!!&rdquo; Made me chuckle, my kind of girl.</p>

<p>I found a transition a little strange, but we ended in some kind of hospital or morgue or something like that. The cleaner explained that we shouldn&rsquo;t be here and it will be bad if the master found us. But as the master was away why don&rsquo;t everyone come closer so we could explore the corpse on the table. I went close enough to stick my nose in the stomach of the corpse, the rest of a group needed a few more invitations. He invited one from the group to hold the bucket and then started taking away the parts of a corpse. &ldquo;Here is the spleen.&rdquo; He pressed it and something wet hit me on the forehead. Someone from the group shouted &ldquo;Oh S<strong>t!!&rdquo; and the cleaner replied &ldquo;No S</strong>t, just piss.&rdquo; The master returned  and told us to hide in the next room which was full of corpses. After a few more scares we moved to the next room.</p>

<p>This time the theme was a trial and thought it had a few funny moments it didn&rsquo;t leave a lasting impression. The next room was some story about witches being burned and then going through a labyrinth. After the labyrinth we were at the city alley with a stake ready for burning a witch. After some talking one girl from the group was chosen and tied to a stake. Maybe not everyone understands what this is safe fun with possible consequences, but seeing the fear in the eyes of that girl about to be burned was something *take a deep breath* &hellip; Well I can&rsquo;t find the words to explain it. A big fire starts roaring, it stops after a bit and only a skeleton left on the stake. I guess you can&rsquo;t save all, time to move to the next live show.</p>

<p>We enter a room in the house and an actor tells us to sit before he could tell the story of this house. I scan the room and choose the seat by the chest as in my opinion it should provide the most fun. I wasn&rsquo;t wrong. I also do the same thing when I enter any room. Just look for a place which will be comfortable enough and would provide a best survivability chance in case some madmen came in through the door shooting/stabbing everyone in his sight. An actor tells a story about a sister killing a sister, hiding her in the basement and if you visit the house on the day she was killed you might see her ghost. As it happens today is the day of her death and then basement door starts banging. The lights go out. Now if you watch &ldquo;horror movies&rdquo; (in quotes because I have my opinion about that) just imagine the scene were it&rsquo;s pitch black, at some points in time a light(ing) flashes so you could see something scary. Fun.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is the end of the attraction. Unless you&rsquo;re some sensitive person who starts running up the ceiling every time something makes a sound (scaring everyone else) I would highly suggest visiting Amsterdam Dungeon. So much fun!</p>
