    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I won&rsquo;t remember that I did in chronological order. Will try to write about the places I visited and my thoughts about them in general.</p>

<p>As now I had museum card it was time to start visiting museums. My suggestion is to either ask your host if he has one or maybe buy it. Depending on how long you&rsquo;re staying and how much you want to visit (Amsterdam card might also work). It&rsquo;s great because if you&rsquo;re visiting a lot of places it can save you a lot. You also don&rsquo;t need to wait in general queue and most of the time can just go in (going through a special queue which rarely has any people).</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t visited it this time, but I would suggest to visit the sex museum which is near train station. The ticket is cheap and you will find a lot of funny items in there.</p>

<p>Van Gogh museum I found interesting. It can be hectic at times with people making long queues. If you just gonna enjoy the paintings themselves, read only about the ones which make you really interested and be unconventional (going opposite direction than everyone) it can be easy to navigate it. Some paintings I liked, others not so much. Even thought after seeing the paintings I think he was a good artist I don&rsquo;t really care about that. That fascinates (I knew this before visiting museum) me about Van Gogh is his choice to paint every day. This is the great reminder that if you do something every day the compounding interest will pay off in the long run. You could also see that he experimented a lot. This is a great idea to keep in the back of your mind, not just do the same thing you did hundreds of time, but to be brave and try something new. I also found his &ldquo;mental problems&rdquo; interesting and would have enjoyed to get more information about it. My recommendation for this museum &ndash; visit it.</p>

<p>Close by is the Rijksmuseum which is hard to miss. You might go by it even if you&rsquo;re not planing on visiting it. I think the toilets are in public space (as far as I remember) so it&rsquo;s an extra reason to visit it (especially for female visitors as they can&rsquo;t take a leek in the street). The museum is big. As I missed where you could get a map navigating it was a bit of a challenge trying to decide if you went down this corridor or not. It&rsquo;s split into many cultures / times / purpose blocks so you will see a lot of different things. Parts of it can be explored in a relaxing manner. Parts of it are so saturated with tourists that you just want to get away as far as possible (especially the paintings). I think the book lovers would especially like the library as at least my first thought after entering it was &ldquo;I want this room.&rdquo; At least before I remembered I&rsquo;m allergic to things. It will take a while and some legwork to visit all museum, but I enjoyed it and suggest to visit it.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17333620578/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10448686_10202296477433903_6185703472155902306_o"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8727/17333620578_d4fbced7fa_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="10448686_10202296477433903_6185703472155902306_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If your stay in Amsterdam is short and you need to optimize your visiting this general area is a great start. You have the Rijksmuseum with small a park (a nice place to sit down, relax and read a book). On the right side you have the Van Gogh museum. Between them is the small pool and a park and a big letter sign. On the right you also have some other museums.</p>

<p>For me I didn&rsquo;t find the diamonds museum that much interesting. That is because of my personality. I just can&rsquo;t understand the point of paying so much for some shiny, useless (then used as a jewelry) peace of stone. For me it&rsquo;s worth as much as some fake stone for a few bucks. They still look the same and as you won&rsquo;t be sawing any walls they both serve the same purpose of being useless. If you have some free time to kill you might go visit it, it wasn&rsquo;t the worst place I visited.</p>

<p>Close by you will find House of Bols, the Cocktail &amp; Genever Experience museum. Which I visited mostly because of &ldquo;learn something and get drunk, sure, why not&rdquo; (being sober wasn&rsquo;t on my plan at that point in life). I would just suggest to skip this one. It isn&rsquo;t cheap, you won&rsquo;t learn a lot and most of it feels like being in a big commercial and the drink at the end isn&rsquo;t that good (at least mine wasn&rsquo;t). Rather buy some snacks, a bottle of wine and go to Vondelpark which is close by. Have a picnic. If you would like to eat behind a table there is a street which whole focus is on food. Just can&rsquo;t remember where, but if you would walk past it you would notice as everyone is trying to get you inside. Walking away often is met with additions for free drink or some other way to sweeten the deal.</p>

<p>As my walk from the place I was staying to central streets always led through Amsterdam museum I decided to visit at some point. Not for long. I found it confusing (navigation) and requiring a lot of attention/effort. It soon looked like something I&rsquo;m not enjoying and just left. Your experience may vary.</p>

<p>In the center square is Madame Tussauds wax museum. I was trying to decide if I should visit, but in the end decided to skip it. Mostly because seeing &ldquo;From this point on you have only to wait 20 minutes.&rdquo; How about, No. Also, looking at wax sculptures of the people I don&rsquo;t care about isn&rsquo;t something I find exciting. Especially when you can see much more excitement by walking down the Red Light District which is only a couple minutes away. Close by is a church to which I went simple because I had a free pass with museum card. Also to test if I turn to ashes after going past the doors (I had my doubts). Meh, there are more interesting things to see. Quick circle around and I&rsquo;m out the doors (also don&rsquo;t want to take the chance on turning to ashes, just in case where was a lag in the system).</p>

<p>From tourist kiosks you can buy the tickets to museums/attractions. Depending on what you get it can save you at least a few euros. In my opinion it&rsquo;s worth to check out the options, especially if you know you will be visiting them. Just make sure you have all the information about the ticket. For example if you buy the ticket for Body Works you&rsquo;re allowed to use it only from 4 pm (there are other options). It only works until 6 pm so you would want to there as soon as you&rsquo;re allowed to use the ticket. I was thinking that about an hour should be enough for it so arrived a bit later. That I didn&rsquo;t take into consideration is how big it&rsquo;s and it would be so fun that I will want to read everything. Everyone would have his own definition of fun. As someone who gets hungry watching an autopsy I found this exhibition a lot of fun. You start at the sixth floor and go down until you reach the basement. Every floor has a theme, like bones, muscles, reproduction, sex, etc. The first few floors I was able to explore undisturbed. Then an employer started shadowing me blocking the doors back to the previous floor. Then she started asking if I knew they worked until 6 pm and in the end just plainly suggesting what you might want to pick up the pace. The basement contains the sex theme and if you ever wondered how the act of making love looked from inside this is your chance. I would highly suggest visiting this exhibit, but I think it would depend on how hard your stomach is.</p>

<p>You might be inclined to drive a bike around Amsterdam. I would just suggest simply walking around. In a nice weather it is relaxing. You&rsquo;re able to pay more attention to your surroundings and Amsterdam has a lot of nice places and hidden gems. Just make sure you pay attention and don&rsquo;t stand in goofing around in car/bike road.</p>

<p>During some random walks I found a few rich people houses made museums including free entry with museum card. Some have some pros to them like a nice garden. Others might have some strange things like a church in the attic. In summary it wasn&rsquo;t bad to learn how people lived before we had internet and computers and it was a way to kill some time. That I liked about visiting them is that it hardened my choice of being minimalist as all that to me looked so pointless. You might have already noticed this about me, but after returning back home I&rsquo;m almost put everything I own in the middle of the room and put it on fire. Made a compromise to send everything I don&rsquo;t need to my friends the next day.</p>

<p>The museum card also allowed me to visit a photo gallery and I was pleasantly surprised. Part of the gallery was closed and part of it just tried to sell you something. The thing I liked and was surprised by was that it was having an exhibition by Larry Clark (if you don&rsquo;t know who he is just know that it will be NSFW).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the morning it felt great to have my cup of tea in front of a fleet of ducks. I like water, it&rsquo;s relaxing. As the houseboat required maintenance we moved to hosts' house which was close to city center. It was a nice place. The only problem was that internet connection was down. For someone who requires it for working this wasn&rsquo;t good news. At least the host could hotspot his phone, but the speed of it was as exciting as counting dust falling. I could hardly check my email. After having a birthday breakfast prepared by the host I went out for a random walk around the city. My first destination was to check out NEMO science center. We saw it while taking a taxi ride and it looked interesting. It didn&rsquo;t look that interesting after I found out you have to take the stairs to the top. Was starting to think if I should even bother with it. Well, nothing is easy in life and you need to put some effort if you want something back. Climbing them wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I thought, just the first 10 steps looked terrible. You can see most of the Amsterdam from the roof and it&rsquo;s a nice place to relax (as long as you stay away from kids). I chose a quiet spot and sit down to read Psycho Cybernetics. You can&rsquo;t get the original on kindle and I chose to return without it after a trip.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17333628968" title="10438926_10202278717309911_6209002604154581610_n by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7690/17333628968_eb54ccf813_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="10438926_10202278717309911_6209002604154581610_n"></a></p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t remember exactly which places I visited, but I took a large circle around town. I roughly guessing that during my trips I walk about 10-20 kilometers per day. Of course Amsterdam is a great city to rent a bike and explore it this way, but I don&rsquo;t see a point for that personally. For me I get tired about the same. It&rsquo;s just the question of time (bike takes a bit less) which I had enough, so I chose the transport type I like most &ndash; my legs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/16901198423" title="10269094_10202278718189933_2393730023996421613_o by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7797/16901198423_de904fbbc3_z.jpg" width="640" height="452" alt="10269094_10202278718189933_2393730023996421613_o"></a></p>

<p>After returning the host invited to join them to watch a game in a city. Unlike most people think I&rsquo;m not against the sports and if I had enough health or skills I would do them. That I don&rsquo;t understand is the point of watching a bunch of people with the ball. I can find more interesting things to do. Recently someone asked &ldquo;what things?&rdquo; and my answer was &ldquo;You&rsquo;re old enough, use your imagination.&rdquo; But sure, why not, let&rsquo;s try it, who knows maybe I will enjoy it. The game was a nice one, but I could still just watch 2 minute reel the next day and save at least an hour.</p>

<p>The tip time: <em>avoid drinking beer (or a lot of any beverage) in Netherlands</em>. Why? Because you have to pay for the toilet in bars. And no, they don&rsquo;t care that you&rsquo;re a customer. You want to piss &ndash; you pay. As they don&rsquo;t even have normal beer (meaning you can drink as much as you want and you won&rsquo;t get drunk) if you went a little overboard you could end up spending more on WC than on the drinks. Drink responsibly.</p>

<p>After a while we went to a house boat. Amsterdam is beautiful during the night. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I personally find it funny when people try to hide the usage of drugs. Like if you close yourself in the toilet and I hear *cocaine snorting sounds* like I will be thinking that you&rsquo;re cleaning the toilet. Then four of us went to a club. One high on cocaine, one on ecstasy, one on weed and one (me) had a few beers. And from that I saw, I still had the most fun (and it wasn&rsquo;t a fun night). Before entering we first had to wait until some overdosed girl was taken out. Kids, use drugs responsibly.</p>

<p>You might kind of guess it, but I&rsquo;m not a big fan of clubs. I&rsquo;m not against them or anything, it&rsquo;s just not for me. If it&rsquo;s impossible to have a normal conversation (the one were your only reply is nod then lips stop moving) then the place is too loud. Give me one person who loves to talk (I&rsquo;m better listener than talker), a cup of tea, cozy atmosphere and I will be having the best night of my life. The place was crowded, full of smoke and DJs were so terrible that I wanted to go to them and slap them in the face and just tell them to leave the Spotify playing without messing with controls. One thing I noticed is that I stopped caring about tobacco smokes. Don&rsquo;t like it, it makes me nauseating, but don&rsquo;t care and don&rsquo;t ever want to do that again. Then came 3 AM and I think I know how Cinderella must have felt when midnight came. All the better looking (from outside) ass grinders (girls that grind their asses into anything that moves or doesn&rsquo;t move) in a blink of an eye changed into some alligator monsters. Group or no group, I don&rsquo;t care, I chose not to stay a second longer in there. They looked hungry and I&rsquo;m too old to be grinded into a wall.</p>

<p>The next day I chose to go to Westerpark because it looked like a big splash of green and was close from my position. My suggestion is just to avoid it and better go to Vondelpark. Only the start of it is a real park and the rest is I think some kind off housings (haven&rsquo;t found the entry). You end up walking a side street all the way around without being able to enjoy any greenery. As my new host will be able to check-in me only in the evening we made a deal that I will leave some things at her place so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to walk with them everywhere tomorrow (knowing with how much I travel it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal). Can&rsquo;t remember the exact description but it make me happy thinking about &ldquo;go meet a girl in a red dress.&rdquo; Sometimes silly things make you smile. Went by the Anne Frank house and right away I knew that I won&rsquo;t be visiting it (especially after the host added some more info about it). No way I&rsquo;m standing in that long of a line for something I don&rsquo;t find interesting. I was invited for a cup of tea, we talked and learned about each other. One of many enjoyable conversations we had with the host. Can&rsquo;t remember that I did for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The next day after waking up and noticing that WiFi is still not available I packed my stuff and left. The host was not home, but I was not going to waste precious hours I could spend working and earning money to pay off this trip. The weather was gray and wet, not enjoyable. I chose to stop at some organic burger place with a big table in the corner (window included). You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how productive you can be after changing the scenery and with a cold beer nearby. Did all my planned work in about an hour surprising myself and my client. Too bad I was charging by an hour. Time for another tip. In Amsterdam you don&rsquo;t need to worry much if you might need WiFi for something. Some places require using some app (skip those), some have it available (you stand in the street doing what you do) and some have the password on their menu. You might need to shop around to find the WiFi you like, but you will find it somewhere if needed.</p>

<p>The new place I was staying at was a bit strange, but nice. Third floor, from one window you can see the street and canals. My room was in the attic which has a window to the inner yard. It was quiet except for birds singing (strangely I liked that). Most of the mornings I woke up with sun tickling my naked leg. The architecture I found a bit strange and hard to figure out. Every day I had to watch out not to be killed by circular stairs or low ceilings (I&rsquo;m tall). Also I find it strange that everything is small when Dutch people are tall. I think some great-great-grandfather just went &ldquo;How about we mess up with future generations and build everything small?&rdquo; The host was a very lively French girl. I enjoyed our conversations and dinners together a lot. We became friends during this trip. She found my approach to minimalism interesting. She accepted my suggestion to try it out and simplify her own life by removing material chains. I also gave her many heart attacks (which I found satisfying) as most people are not used to someone who moves around like a ghost.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Review of Dutch PHP 2015 Conference]]></title>
    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/dutch-php-2015-conference-review"/>

    <id>http://ifdattic.com/review-of-dutch-php-2015-conference</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On June of 2015 I attended the Dutch PHP conference and this is a short review of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/19264000576" title="Dutch PHP 2015 Conference by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/408/19264000576_4272fa2fa2_z.jpg" width="640" height="303" alt="Dutch PHP 2015 Conference"></a></p>

<p>The conference was at Amsterdam RAI venue which is outside city center. Organizers provided directions how to get to it from city center and it&rsquo;s not hard to find. Depending on where you&rsquo;re staying for conference it might have been easier or harder to reach it. I heard some people that they would like it closer to their hotel as they don&rsquo;t want to figure out how to use public transport or take it for 20 minutes to get to the venue. I didn&rsquo;t had a direct route from my airbnb place to the venue, but it was not a big problem for me. For someone who likes exploring places by choosing a direction and walking in it a 45 minute walk to venue is a good way to freshen up my head.</p>

<p>Venue is big and well supported by staff. Signs make it easy to find where you need to go. The staff is always available to provide you with refreshments (tea, coffee, juice, water) and clean up. Stand up tables make it easy to discuss with other people while having a refreshment and sitting desks are comfortable if you need to do some work.</p>

<p>This might be normal for Dutch people, but I don&rsquo;t think of a bunch of cold sandwiches as a normal lunch. For someone who tries to avoid carbs it&rsquo;s nerving to think how many days will be spent feeling like crap from all that bread. I guess this is my own problem for not preparing and bringing something to eat. Still, from all my experience I personally hate Dutch food, not my cuisine.</p>

<p>On first day I was attending <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14190">Introduction to Event Sourcing and CQRS</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/beausimensen">Beau D. Simensen</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/willemjanz">Willem-Jan Zijderveld</a>. Lately I&rsquo;m very into Domain Driven Design and similar ways of improving applications so this workshop gave a good introduction into CQRS. The first part of workshop was explaining all the principles. Found that trying to follow the host and do it on my own laptop wasn&rsquo;t very easy due to it going too fast and having some issues. After deciding to just follow the host found the experience much better. This allowed to focus better on that is going on rather than trying to multi-task. The second part of the workshop was doing the same things, but using Broadway library. Think the workshop was well done. It might be better if the git repository was tagged after each step, so for anyone trying to follow along if they are getting behind they could just checkout the step being currently done.</p>

<p>After the workshops anyone who wanted could attend code night. During it you could work on one of available open source projects helping to improve them. It had drinks, pizza and great people to talk &amp; work with. At the end of code night during the raffle it was possible to win some prizes. It was well organized and think the code night was a success. Watch the time lapse videos of it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShfMqa57PMM">part 1</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4d04rImZAU">part 2</a>).</p>

<p>The conference had a lot of sponsors. You could play games, pick up swag, learn about new tools in sponsor booths. At the end of the conference it was possible to win prizes through the raffle.</p>

<p>Only the second talk was delayed by 15 minutes, but otherwise all conference run like well maintained clock. All talks were on time, none went over, good amount of breaks between tasks.</p>

<p>For each time slot 5 different talks were going at the same time. For anyone interested an un-official talks were available. The talks were very well done with all/most of the problems fixed (from the talks I attended). The talks weren&rsquo;t just about PHP so you could always choose topics which interest you most (devops, testing, JavaScript, CSS, etc.).</p>

<p>The opening keynote was <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14478">Hacking Foresight from Hindsight</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/joshholmes">Josh Holmes</a>. The important point of the talk was that we shouldn&rsquo;t try to do everything ourselves and should try to find mentors who will help us grow faster professionally &amp; personally.</p>

<p>For the first talk I went to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14208">Get some hypermedia up in your API</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/victorwelling">Victor Welling</a>. During it he explained how to solve problems like documentation, versioning, visibility of your API by extending with with HAL.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a tall guy and ergonomically it&rsquo;s more comfortable to stay farther away from the screen. At that moment decided to experiment with sitting in the front rows. You don&rsquo;t need to spend all the time looking at the screen and found that I enjoyed having a closer proximity/relationship with a speaker much more than being able to see the screen all the time.</p>

<p>The second talk I chose was <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14211">Automation made simple with Ansible</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/erikaheidi">Erika Heidi</a>. I played a little with Ansible before. Repetition helps with retaining information. The talk gradually explains what is possible with Ansible and after it you should be in a good position to play around with it in your projects. After talking with Erika between talks, I think now I know how my phone feels when I plug it to charge the batteries. She is a very positive girl and talking with her you can feel your own batteries charging.</p>

<p>Had a hard choice for third talk as Mathias Verraes &amp; Matthias Noback was talking at the same slot. Chose to go to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14214">Towards Modelling Processes</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes">Mathias Verraes</a>. Talk had a simulated event storming and the main point of talk was explaining how to think in temporal model, not just structural.</p>

<p>Was a little late for <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14219">Command Bus to Awesome Town</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/rosstuck">Ross Tuck</a> talk. The speaker was lively with enough jokes between the slides. The talk explained what is command bus &amp; why/how you might want to use one in your project.</p>

<p>During the conference I went to enough talks about event sourcing and similar topics, but going to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14226">Let&rsquo;s Write Some History!</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/willemjanz">Willem-Jan Zijderveld</a> helped me to understand a few more concepts I was missing/confused.</p>

<p>For last first day talk I chose <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14231">Journey into your Lizard Brain</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/rdohms">Rafael Dohms</a>. During it he shared a personal story, explained how developers think &amp; gave tips on how to become a better developer. One of the most important points in my opinion would be to focus on the current moment. I think conferences could have more of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; talks as I find them refreshing when mixed with technical talks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/18667539664" title="DPC15 - Journey into your Lizard Brain by Rafael Dohms by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/469/18667539664_38611826a4_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="DPC15 - Journey into your Lizard Brain by Rafael Dohms"></a></p>

<p>The Conference Social was at Akhnaton. Organizers provided directions how to get from venue to it. It was easy to find the bar and after arrival everyone received drink tokens. Received enough tokens to spend the rest of the evening with a bottle of water in my hand (might be a different experience depending on your drinking habits).</p>

<p>The day before I decided to skip the morning talk. Even thought woke up refreshed I&rsquo;m trying to learn to make a decision and keep with it (unless the situation changes).</p>

<p>For second talk I went to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14238">Hexagonal architecture &ndash; message-oriented software design</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/matthiasnoback">Matthias Noback</a>. The talk was well paced, explaining how to improve your applications by focusing on messages.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/19293946821" title="DPC15 - Hexagonal architecture - message-oriented software design by Matthias Noback by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/445/19293946821_426765221f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="DPC15 - Hexagonal architecture - message-oriented software design by Matthias Noback"></a></p>

<p>I think the composer is a wonderful tool making my life much easier. I think I know enough of it to do what is needed and advise others of best practices (like using CLI and not editing JSON file). It never hurts to make sure so I went to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14245">Composer The Right Way</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/rdohms">Rafael Dohms</a>. The talk explained some parts which you might not use so often &amp; how to use composer better. If you don&rsquo;t use composer (or know what it is) stop making your life harder!</p>

<p>For the fourth talk was thinking about going to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14248">Implement Single Sign On easily with Symfony</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Saro0h">Sarah Khalil</a>. When considered that can&rsquo;t think of anything were I would need to implement it in the near future and need to mix a less technical talk for better ratio. Went to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14249">Software architecture in an agile age</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/harrieverveer">Harrie Verveer</a>. Maybe it&rsquo;s the trauma from college when had to do a lot of UML diagrams or maybe being sleepy after lunch, but expected a little more from the talk. It was still a good talk explaining how to work better on your projects. I agree with most important idea what no matter which format you use it&rsquo;s good to make at least few notes/diagrams before you start building things.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/19284034222" title="DPC15 - Software architecture in an agile age by Harrie Verveer by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/357/19284034222_5f5d050fb2_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="DPC15 - Software architecture in an agile age by Harrie Verveer"></a></p>

<p>For last talk chose to go to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14253">Adding 1.21 Gigawatts to Application with RabbitMQ</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/asgrim">James Titcumb</a>. The talk is very technical with code examples and at some points it can feel a little dry. We talked with a speaker about how it can be improved. The talk explains very well how to use RabbitMQ in your projects, including pitfalls to avoid.</p>

<p>The closing keynote <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14639">Behind the Scenes of Maintaining an Open Source Project</a> was done by <a href="https://twitter.com/seldaek">Jordi Boggiano</a> about how open source project looks behind the scenes. He went through different stages of it (maintenance, anger, etc.) including anecdotes and personal stories. Staying behind the screen we often forget about the world behind our backs and that open source is only possible thanks to the community and people who spend their energy &amp; time.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the conference a lot and really happy about attending it. It&rsquo;s was nice to put Twitter/GitHub profiles with real people. Would like to thank the organizers, speakers, audience for three great days of new experiences &amp; sharing knowledge. In the end I would like to borrow (in other words steal) the quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/michellesanver">Michelle Sanver</a> which summarizes what is a conference very well &ndash; &ldquo;<em><a href="https://blog.liip.ch/archive/2015/02/10/conferences-that-are-parties-with-talks-phpbenelux-and-sunshinephp.html">A conference is a party with talks</a></em>&rdquo;</p>

    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/review-zivamind-meditation-course"/>
    <updated>2015-06-18T15:29:48+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://ifdattic.com/review-of-zivamind-meditation-course</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If I notice something to be continuously mentioned, it might have some truth to it. When looking into that top performers (like <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/02/02/arnold-schwarzenegger/">Tim Ferriss, Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, etc.) do, most of the time the meditation is mentioned. <strong>As I would like to be top performer after I grow up meditation is something I want to have as a habit</strong>. Had a powerful experience once so know it can be a powerful tool.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/18736614889" title="Review of ZivaMind Meditation Course by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/308/18736614889_f916ca658e_z.jpg" width="640" height="320" alt="Review of ZivaMind Meditation Course"></a></p>

<p>The problem is what I&rsquo;m <strong>having problems finding one which would work for me</strong>. Most of them are spiritual. With some hairy guru, flowers and other elements which should bring peace &amp; bliss. For me the line between spiritual enough &amp; too spiritual is thin. I have nothing against it &amp; I&rsquo;m happy if it works for other people. For me, it makes me cringe. Just like the word God. (I like using it when cursing. Don&rsquo;t put any weight to it as it means nothing to me. Might throw away a great book just for using that word too much.) To give some anchor point to me even <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace application</a> is too spiritual. Just can&rsquo;t stomach that guru voice, it&rsquo;s me not you.</p>

<p>Another problem is what I always <strong>had problems keeping meditating for long</strong>. Would start strong, do it every day for a week or two. Then I will have a day or few where &ldquo;<em>I have no time</em>&rdquo; for it. Or the cheating will start making it more like a nap.</p>

<p>One day watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC7a_gQB9YQ">Google talk with an Emily Fletcher about meditation</a>. Maybe her &ldquo;positivity&rdquo; was a bit too much. I don&rsquo;t like that in people. Think it&rsquo;s because if you took a scalpel deep enough into my brains you will find it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m not like that &amp; would love to be. A lot of points in the talk made sense to me.</p>

<p>After looking more into what Emily does decided to try her <a href="http://www.zivamind.com/">ZivaMind meditation course</a>. <strong>If you fail, try again</strong>.</p>

<p>The course isn&rsquo;t cheap (250$ at the time of purchase). But it&rsquo;s only if it wouldn&rsquo;t work, if it works that price would be a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s delivered in 8 days with some extras added</strong>. Some of the days you&rsquo;re asked to answer few questions to bring your awareness. Don&rsquo;t think that you only need 8 days to become a master and start flying around on your bliss. This is the time you will need to consume the lessons to be in position to continue the meditation practice by yourself. After 8 days you might still have a lot of questions. A lot of them are answered in a recorded call(s) (day 9 of course).</p>

<p>The great thing about the course I liked is that <strong>it almost has no spiritual stuff</strong>. It has the mantra which I will put in spiritual category. I don&rsquo;t mind it so much as it&rsquo;s used as a tool to anchor yourself when you start wondering too much. Found it helpful.</p>

<p><strong>I like delivery of course a lot</strong>. Like explaining that you don&rsquo;t need to do it for hours or become a monk to reap the benefits of meditation. It helps to calm yourself knowing that 15 minutes twice a day is something you can do. Of course if it won&rsquo;t work then meditation is out the window as becoming a monk won&rsquo;t help either. <strong>Showing how a meditation session might look is very helpful</strong>. After seeing it you stop beating yourself that you&rsquo;re doing it wrong or you will never be able to do it right or you think too much, etc.</p>

<p>The website application of the course could be better. For someone who works in web &amp; cares about security, receiving his password in email can lead to a heart attack. It doesn&rsquo;t remember that I have logged in so every day requires me to log back in.</p>

<p>A new day of meditation is enabled every 24 hours. Which I understand but don&rsquo;t think is a good choice. I think it would be better if a new one was made available after 16 hours. For first few days it wasn&rsquo;t an issue. After that I started waking up early and a new day wasn&rsquo;t available to me. Just make the change on the application, it&rsquo;s fine if mails are sent every 24 hours. And if someone is counting the end of 16 hours just to check the new video they have bigger problems.</p>

<p>One of the days contained a video about space. Have no efing idea what it was about or what it has to do with meditation. Some spiritual thought provoking time &ndash; yes, but I would rather it was not added.</p>

<p>In one video you&rsquo;re taught a breathing technique to help you meditate. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t do it. As someone who has only one nostril working most of the time, anything breathing related is uncomfortably painful. If you have never drowned, choked, suffocated &mdash; yes, I&rsquo;m that good at accidental suicides &mdash; it would be hard to explain the feeling.</p>

<p>The course provides audio files to help meditate for various reasons: sleep, travel, performance. They are helpful, but from that I noticed they have white noise during silent periods which makes it hard to concentrate. It could also have lite versions which contained less explanations (explanations are good for beginning). <strong>The video version of 15 minute meditation I found very helpful</strong>. Most of it is silence, but that I liked about them is that I don&rsquo;t have to keep eyes on the clock. Having a timer application running is not a problem. It&rsquo;s just a better quality meditation if I keep my eyes closed through it. It would be great if audio version of this was available (without white noise).</p>

<p><strong>The suggestion to use the last few minutes of meditation for gratitude is great</strong>. I have a habit of being grateful for 3 things each day, big or small. Makes you appreciate your life &amp; what you have a lot more. Those few minutes were I run through all the things that happened &amp; I&rsquo;m grateful for makes me even happier.</p>

<p>I just started the course &amp; need to keep it for longer to know if it works. So far my thoughts are positive and feeling good with sticking with it. Doubt that I will find anything better &amp; if it won&rsquo;t work then the problem is somewhere else. <strong>If like me you have problems with making meditation a habit I would suggest to try out the <a href="http://www.zivamind.com/">ZivaMind meditation course</a></strong>.</p>

    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/amsterdam-phone-std-and-parks"/>
    <updated>2015-06-03T09:55:35+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://ifdattic.com/amsterdam-phone-std-and-parks-part-2-testing-the-world-and-looking-for-home-series</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After taking an inventory of what happened so far decided now was the time to:</p>

<ul>
<li>check where to find the places suggested by the host (shops, restaurants, etc.);</li>
<li>buy the local SIM card for internet;</li>
<li>get something to eat.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was in no hurry to start going through museums and similar places. I was here for two weeks and decided to spend the weekend just exploring the city. Also after I move to another place I will receive the museum card from my host, saving me some money &amp; time.</p>

<p>After a while I went inside one shop which looked like they were selling SIM cards. If you want to imagine the conversation better the merchant was Indian (like Russell Peters said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make stereotypes, I see them&rdquo;).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, I would like a local SIM card with a data plan, do you have any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, yes, it will be 20 € please. What model is your phone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Nexus 5 <em>*confused with a raised eyebrow*</em>, does it make any difference?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never had Nexus, I can do Apple, Samsung, Nokia. Here are the instructions how to install it. I don&rsquo;t know if it will work on your phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some haggling we decided to try and if it will work, I will pay. If it will not work he will take the card back and I will not need to pay. Good deal, <em>I have nothing to lose after all, or so I thought</em>. After changing the card and rebooting the phone the language automatically changed to Dutch (without asking me about it), started installing some apps and if you enter the settings (to change the language or enable WiFi) the application would just close down. WTF?!? <em>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting my phone catching an STD</em>. I had doubts about myself, who knows were I might end sticking my USB stick in, but I didn&rsquo;t expect this happening to my phone. Thanked the shop keeper for trying and left without local SIM card.</p>

<p>Continued to keep going down the street as somewhere around here was a park (I love green &amp; blue colors on maps). At the same time trying to figure out how to at least change the language to English. What I found is what if you restart the phone you have about few seconds of browsing the settings app before it&rsquo;s closed. Not an easy task to change something in few seconds when you don&rsquo;t even know where it is. After a while I just gave up as this was unsustainable. Restarting the phone took about a minute and it provides only a few seconds which probably won&rsquo;t be enough. Another problem was what I was kind of lost, the GPS/maps application was in Dutch and without any cache. <em>The easy way would be just to go back, which is boring</em>. After calculating the direction I should move to I continued my travels.</p>

<p>After reaching a place which was close to the boat house stopped for some traditional Dutch pancakes. At first trying to think how to fix the phone. Soon changed that with just drinking my mint tea with honey and enjoying the fresh air. Decided my best choice would be to go back home, try to figure out how to fix my phone or at least to cache the map.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17333602178" title="Traditional Dutch Pancakes by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8879/17333602178_1f965387dc_z.jpg" width="474" height="640" alt="Traditional Dutch Pancakes"></a></p>

<p>The Google wasn&rsquo;t helpful with answers about what I should do. Except for step-by-step instructions where to find the languages. Which wasn&rsquo;t helpful as settings application wasn&rsquo;t working. In the end I was able to fix my phone. Not really sure why or how, but I was glad for settings application to start working allowing me to go back to English language. The fix was kind of simple. Inserted my original SIM card which doesn&rsquo;t work outside my country, but I&rsquo;m guessing the &ldquo;virus&rdquo; figured it was not able to do his thing and just left. Or something along those lines. It&rsquo;s a mystery to me. I was just glad for it to start working the way it&rsquo;s supposed to work. Except for antivirus being in English which I was able to change only after about a month.</p>

<p>Back in full gear went to look for that park again. Small, but nice park. As long as you don&rsquo;t step into any dog shit that is. Decided it&rsquo;s time to visit the Vondelpark park. It was the weekend and streets can get noisy from all the tourists who come to be loud, be stupid, be drunk, be unhappy and be back in 9-to-5 job on Monday. Don&rsquo;t get offended if any of those describe you. <em>I don&rsquo;t have anything against having some fun (choose your own definition)</em> or anything like that, I just don&rsquo;t think that because it&rsquo;s the weekend and you went to another country it allows you to be an idiot. <strong>I know common sense is dead, but try to find it</strong>.</p>

<p>The Vondelpark is wonderful. It&rsquo;s a large area with green zones, water and all kinds of people in it. If the day is sunny &amp; warm it&rsquo;s perfect to just lie down and relax, maybe with a book, maybe without one. It takes a while to walk through whole park, especially if you get lost as roads can sometime get confusing (they are wiggly). It has public toilets, refreshments (you can always bring your own), benches. It should take care of most of your needs. You will also meet some &ldquo;strange people&rdquo;, I call them &ldquo;crackers.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t know why but this is what comes to my head then I think about them (in the voice of Eddie Griffin). I met three different categories during my two weeks. The first one being friendly ones which talk with you about something and  after a bit asks if maybe you could share some coins. The second one was similar to friendlies except I call them idiots. I try to be positive, but when you tell me about how hard their life is and they have no money for food because he wasted couple hundred euros yesterday in casino. Sorry, this is were I draw the line and walk away. I&rsquo;m not good enough yet to deal with this kind of situations. The third one are the aggressive kind and best to avoid as it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if one of them stabbed you (I have good imagination).</p>

<p>Before leaving the park stopped to listen to one guy playing incredible jazz music. Liked it so much that stopped to listen to it while talking with his friends. They were from Chile and damn, their language is beautiful. A bit later two other people stopped to listen to music and join the conversation. After a while a new guy mentioned that if someone wants Marilyn Monroe LSD he has some to sell. I would guess it would be an easy way to spice up my birthday and after listening to Tim Ferriss podcast I sometimes wonder that it would be a positive experience to experiment a little with psychedelic drugs. The thing is that some risks I like to take in the controlled environment. <em>Taking who knows what, with who knows who, who knows were for me personally isn&rsquo;t that comforting or something I couldn&rsquo;t live without</em>.</p>
