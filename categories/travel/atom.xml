    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I won&rsquo;t remember that I did in chronological order. Will try to write about the places I visited and my thoughts about them in general.</p>

<p>As now I had museum card it was time to start visiting museums. My suggestion is to either ask your host if he has one or maybe buy it. Depending on how long you&rsquo;re staying and how much you want to visit (Amsterdam card might also work). It&rsquo;s great because if you&rsquo;re visiting a lot of places it can save you a lot. You also don&rsquo;t need to wait in general queue and most of the time can just go in (going through a special queue which rarely has any people).</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t visited it this time, but I would suggest to visit the sex museum which is near train station. The ticket is cheap and you will find a lot of funny items in there.</p>

<p>Van Gogh museum I found interesting. It can be hectic at times with people making long queues. If you just gonna enjoy the paintings themselves, read only about the ones which make you really interested and be unconventional (going opposite direction than everyone) it can be easy to navigate it. Some paintings I liked, others not so much. Even thought after seeing the paintings I think he was a good artist I don&rsquo;t really care about that. That fascinates (I knew this before visiting museum) me about Van Gogh is his choice to paint every day. This is the great reminder that if you do something every day the compounding interest will pay off in the long run. You could also see that he experimented a lot. This is a great idea to keep in the back of your mind, not just do the same thing you did hundreds of time, but to be brave and try something new. I also found his &ldquo;mental problems&rdquo; interesting and would have enjoyed to get more information about it. My recommendation for this museum &ndash; visit it.</p>

<p>Close by is the Rijksmuseum which is hard to miss. You might go by it even if you&rsquo;re not planing on visiting it. I think the toilets are in public space (as far as I remember) so it&rsquo;s an extra reason to visit it (especially for female visitors as they can&rsquo;t take a leek in the street). The museum is big. As I missed where you could get a map navigating it was a bit of a challenge trying to decide if you went down this corridor or not. It&rsquo;s split into many cultures / times / purpose blocks so you will see a lot of different things. Parts of it can be explored in a relaxing manner. Parts of it are so saturated with tourists that you just want to get away as far as possible (especially the paintings). I think the book lovers would especially like the library as at least my first thought after entering it was &ldquo;I want this room.&rdquo; At least before I remembered I&rsquo;m allergic to things. It will take a while and some legwork to visit all museum, but I enjoyed it and suggest to visit it.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17333620578/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10448686_10202296477433903_6185703472155902306_o"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8727/17333620578_d4fbced7fa_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="10448686_10202296477433903_6185703472155902306_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If your stay in Amsterdam is short and you need to optimize your visiting this general area is a great start. You have the Rijksmuseum with small a park (a nice place to sit down, relax and read a book). On the right side you have the Van Gogh museum. Between them is the small pool and a park and a big letter sign. On the right you also have some other museums.</p>

<p>For me I didn&rsquo;t find the diamonds museum that much interesting. That is because of my personality. I just can&rsquo;t understand the point of paying so much for some shiny, useless (then used as a jewelry) peace of stone. For me it&rsquo;s worth as much as some fake stone for a few bucks. They still look the same and as you won&rsquo;t be sawing any walls they both serve the same purpose of being useless. If you have some free time to kill you might go visit it, it wasn&rsquo;t the worst place I visited.</p>

<p>Close by you will find House of Bols, the Cocktail &amp; Genever Experience museum. Which I visited mostly because of &ldquo;learn something and get drunk, sure, why not&rdquo; (being sober wasn&rsquo;t on my plan at that point in life). I would just suggest to skip this one. It isn&rsquo;t cheap, you won&rsquo;t learn a lot and most of it feels like being in a big commercial and the drink at the end isn&rsquo;t that good (at least mine wasn&rsquo;t). Rather buy some snacks, a bottle of wine and go to Vondelpark which is close by. Have a picnic. If you would like to eat behind a table there is a street which whole focus is on food. Just can&rsquo;t remember where, but if you would walk past it you would notice as everyone is trying to get you inside. Walking away often is met with additions for free drink or some other way to sweeten the deal.</p>

<p>As my walk from the place I was staying to central streets always led through Amsterdam museum I decided to visit at some point. Not for long. I found it confusing (navigation) and requiring a lot of attention/effort. It soon looked like something I&rsquo;m not enjoying and just left. Your experience may vary.</p>

<p>In the center square is Madame Tussauds wax museum. I was trying to decide if I should visit, but in the end decided to skip it. Mostly because seeing &ldquo;From this point on you have only to wait 20 minutes.&rdquo; How about, No. Also, looking at wax sculptures of the people I don&rsquo;t care about isn&rsquo;t something I find exciting. Especially when you can see much more excitement by walking down the Red Light District which is only a couple minutes away. Close by is a church to which I went simple because I had a free pass with museum card. Also to test if I turn to ashes after going past the doors (I had my doubts). Meh, there are more interesting things to see. Quick circle around and I&rsquo;m out the doors (also don&rsquo;t want to take the chance on turning to ashes, just in case where was a lag in the system).</p>

<p>From tourist kiosks you can buy the tickets to museums/attractions. Depending on what you get it can save you at least a few euros. In my opinion it&rsquo;s worth to check out the options, especially if you know you will be visiting them. Just make sure you have all the information about the ticket. For example if you buy the ticket for Body Works you&rsquo;re allowed to use it only from 4 pm (there are other options). It only works until 6 pm so you would want to there as soon as you&rsquo;re allowed to use the ticket. I was thinking that about an hour should be enough for it so arrived a bit later. That I didn&rsquo;t take into consideration is how big it&rsquo;s and it would be so fun that I will want to read everything. Everyone would have his own definition of fun. As someone who gets hungry watching an autopsy I found this exhibition a lot of fun. You start at the sixth floor and go down until you reach the basement. Every floor has a theme, like bones, muscles, reproduction, sex, etc. The first few floors I was able to explore undisturbed. Then an employer started shadowing me blocking the doors back to the previous floor. Then she started asking if I knew they worked until 6 pm and in the end just plainly suggesting what you might want to pick up the pace. The basement contains the sex theme and if you ever wondered how the act of making love looked from inside this is your chance. I would highly suggest visiting this exhibit, but I think it would depend on how hard your stomach is.</p>

<p>You might be inclined to drive a bike around Amsterdam. I would just suggest simply walking around. In a nice weather it is relaxing. You&rsquo;re able to pay more attention to your surroundings and Amsterdam has a lot of nice places and hidden gems. Just make sure you pay attention and don&rsquo;t stand in goofing around in car/bike road.</p>

<p>During some random walks I found a few rich people houses made museums including free entry with museum card. Some have some pros to them like a nice garden. Others might have some strange things like a church in the attic. In summary it wasn&rsquo;t bad to learn how people lived before we had internet and computers and it was a way to kill some time. That I liked about visiting them is that it hardened my choice of being minimalist as all that to me looked so pointless. You might have already noticed this about me, but after returning back home I&rsquo;m almost put everything I own in the middle of the room and put it on fire. Made a compromise to send everything I don&rsquo;t need to my friends the next day.</p>

<p>The museum card also allowed me to visit a photo gallery and I was pleasantly surprised. Part of the gallery was closed and part of it just tried to sell you something. The thing I liked and was surprised by was that it was having an exhibition by Larry Clark (if you don&rsquo;t know who he is just know that it will be NSFW).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the morning it felt great to have my cup of tea in front of a fleet of ducks. I like water, it&rsquo;s relaxing. As the houseboat required maintenance we moved to hosts' house which was close to city center. It was a nice place. The only problem was that internet connection was down. For someone who requires it for working this wasn&rsquo;t good news. At least the host could hotspot his phone, but the speed of it was as exciting as counting dust falling. I could hardly check my email. After having a birthday breakfast prepared by the host I went out for a random walk around the city. My first destination was to check out NEMO science center. We saw it while taking a taxi ride and it looked interesting. It didn&rsquo;t look that interesting after I found out you have to take the stairs to the top. Was starting to think if I should even bother with it. Well, nothing is easy in life and you need to put some effort if you want something back. Climbing them wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I thought, just the first 10 steps looked terrible. You can see most of the Amsterdam from the roof and it&rsquo;s a nice place to relax (as long as you stay away from kids). I chose a quiet spot and sit down to read Psycho Cybernetics. You can&rsquo;t get the original on kindle and I chose to return without it after a trip.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17333628968" title="10438926_10202278717309911_6209002604154581610_n by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7690/17333628968_eb54ccf813_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="10438926_10202278717309911_6209002604154581610_n"></a></p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t remember exactly which places I visited, but I took a large circle around town. I roughly guessing that during my trips I walk about 10-20 kilometers per day. Of course Amsterdam is a great city to rent a bike and explore it this way, but I don&rsquo;t see a point for that personally. For me I get tired about the same. It&rsquo;s just the question of time (bike takes a bit less) which I had enough, so I chose the transport type I like most &ndash; my legs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/16901198423" title="10269094_10202278718189933_2393730023996421613_o by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7797/16901198423_de904fbbc3_z.jpg" width="640" height="452" alt="10269094_10202278718189933_2393730023996421613_o"></a></p>

<p>After returning the host invited to join them to watch a game in a city. Unlike most people think I&rsquo;m not against the sports and if I had enough health or skills I would do them. That I don&rsquo;t understand is the point of watching a bunch of people with the ball. I can find more interesting things to do. Recently someone asked &ldquo;what things?&rdquo; and my answer was &ldquo;You&rsquo;re old enough, use your imagination.&rdquo; But sure, why not, let&rsquo;s try it, who knows maybe I will enjoy it. The game was a nice one, but I could still just watch 2 minute reel the next day and save at least an hour.</p>

<p>The tip time: <em>avoid drinking beer (or a lot of any beverage) in Netherlands</em>. Why? Because you have to pay for the toilet in bars. And no, they don&rsquo;t care that you&rsquo;re a customer. You want to piss &ndash; you pay. As they don&rsquo;t even have normal beer (meaning you can drink as much as you want and you won&rsquo;t get drunk) if you went a little overboard you could end up spending more on WC than on the drinks. Drink responsibly.</p>

<p>After a while we went to a house boat. Amsterdam is beautiful during the night. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I personally find it funny when people try to hide the usage of drugs. Like if you close yourself in the toilet and I hear *cocaine snorting sounds* like I will be thinking that you&rsquo;re cleaning the toilet. Then four of us went to a club. One high on cocaine, one on ecstasy, one on weed and one (me) had a few beers. And from that I saw, I still had the most fun (and it wasn&rsquo;t a fun night). Before entering we first had to wait until some overdosed girl was taken out. Kids, use drugs responsibly.</p>

<p>You might kind of guess it, but I&rsquo;m not a big fan of clubs. I&rsquo;m not against them or anything, it&rsquo;s just not for me. If it&rsquo;s impossible to have a normal conversation (the one were your only reply is nod then lips stop moving) then the place is too loud. Give me one person who loves to talk (I&rsquo;m better listener than talker), a cup of tea, cozy atmosphere and I will be having the best night of my life. The place was crowded, full of smoke and DJs were so terrible that I wanted to go to them and slap them in the face and just tell them to leave the Spotify playing without messing with controls. One thing I noticed is that I stopped caring about tobacco smokes. Don&rsquo;t like it, it makes me nauseating, but don&rsquo;t care and don&rsquo;t ever want to do that again. Then came 3 AM and I think I know how Cinderella must have felt when midnight came. All the better looking (from outside) ass grinders (girls that grind their asses into anything that moves or doesn&rsquo;t move) in a blink of an eye changed into some alligator monsters. Group or no group, I don&rsquo;t care, I chose not to stay a second longer in there. They looked hungry and I&rsquo;m too old to be grinded into a wall.</p>

<p>The next day I chose to go to Westerpark because it looked like a big splash of green and was close from my position. My suggestion is just to avoid it and better go to Vondelpark. Only the start of it is a real park and the rest is I think some kind off housings (haven&rsquo;t found the entry). You end up walking a side street all the way around without being able to enjoy any greenery. As my new host will be able to check-in me only in the evening we made a deal that I will leave some things at her place so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to walk with them everywhere tomorrow (knowing with how much I travel it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal). Can&rsquo;t remember the exact description but it make me happy thinking about &ldquo;go meet a girl in a red dress.&rdquo; Sometimes silly things make you smile. Went by the Anne Frank house and right away I knew that I won&rsquo;t be visiting it (especially after the host added some more info about it). No way I&rsquo;m standing in that long of a line for something I don&rsquo;t find interesting. I was invited for a cup of tea, we talked and learned about each other. One of many enjoyable conversations we had with the host. Can&rsquo;t remember that I did for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The next day after waking up and noticing that WiFi is still not available I packed my stuff and left. The host was not home, but I was not going to waste precious hours I could spend working and earning money to pay off this trip. The weather was gray and wet, not enjoyable. I chose to stop at some organic burger place with a big table in the corner (window included). You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how productive you can be after changing the scenery and with a cold beer nearby. Did all my planned work in about an hour surprising myself and my client. Too bad I was charging by an hour. Time for another tip. In Amsterdam you don&rsquo;t need to worry much if you might need WiFi for something. Some places require using some app (skip those), some have it available (you stand in the street doing what you do) and some have the password on their menu. You might need to shop around to find the WiFi you like, but you will find it somewhere if needed.</p>

<p>The new place I was staying at was a bit strange, but nice. Third floor, from one window you can see the street and canals. My room was in the attic which has a window to the inner yard. It was quiet except for birds singing (strangely I liked that). Most of the mornings I woke up with sun tickling my naked leg. The architecture I found a bit strange and hard to figure out. Every day I had to watch out not to be killed by circular stairs or low ceilings (I&rsquo;m tall). Also I find it strange that everything is small when Dutch people are tall. I think some great-great-grandfather just went &ldquo;How about we mess up with future generations and build everything small?&rdquo; The host was a very lively French girl. I enjoyed our conversations and dinners together a lot. We became friends during this trip. She found my approach to minimalism interesting. She accepted my suggestion to try it out and simplify her own life by removing material chains. I also gave her many heart attacks (which I found satisfying) as most people are not used to someone who moves around like a ghost.</p>

    <id>http://ifdattic.com/amsterdam-phone-std-and-parks-part-2-testing-the-world-and-looking-for-home-series</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After taking an inventory of what happened so far decided now was the time to:</p>

<ul>
<li>check where to find the places suggested by the host (shops, restaurants, etc.);</li>
<li>buy the local SIM card for internet;</li>
<li>get something to eat.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was in no hurry to start going through museums and similar places. I was here for two weeks and decided to spend the weekend just exploring the city. Also after I move to another place I will receive the museum card from my host, saving me some money &amp; time.</p>

<p>After a while I went inside one shop which looked like they were selling SIM cards. If you want to imagine the conversation better the merchant was Indian (like Russell Peters said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make stereotypes, I see them&rdquo;).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, I would like a local SIM card with a data plan, do you have any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, yes, it will be 20 € please. What model is your phone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Nexus 5 <em>*confused with a raised eyebrow*</em>, does it make any difference?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never had Nexus, I can do Apple, Samsung, Nokia. Here are the instructions how to install it. I don&rsquo;t know if it will work on your phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some haggling we decided to try and if it will work, I will pay. If it will not work he will take the card back and I will not need to pay. Good deal, <em>I have nothing to lose after all, or so I thought</em>. After changing the card and rebooting the phone the language automatically changed to Dutch (without asking me about it), started installing some apps and if you enter the settings (to change the language or enable WiFi) the application would just close down. WTF?!? <em>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting my phone catching an STD</em>. I had doubts about myself, who knows were I might end sticking my USB stick in, but I didn&rsquo;t expect this happening to my phone. Thanked the shop keeper for trying and left without local SIM card.</p>

<p>Continued to keep going down the street as somewhere around here was a park (I love green &amp; blue colors on maps). At the same time trying to figure out how to at least change the language to English. What I found is what if you restart the phone you have about few seconds of browsing the settings app before it&rsquo;s closed. Not an easy task to change something in few seconds when you don&rsquo;t even know where it is. After a while I just gave up as this was unsustainable. Restarting the phone took about a minute and it provides only a few seconds which probably won&rsquo;t be enough. Another problem was what I was kind of lost, the GPS/maps application was in Dutch and without any cache. <em>The easy way would be just to go back, which is boring</em>. After calculating the direction I should move to I continued my travels.</p>

<p>After reaching a place which was close to the boat house stopped for some traditional Dutch pancakes. At first trying to think how to fix the phone. Soon changed that with just drinking my mint tea with honey and enjoying the fresh air. Decided my best choice would be to go back home, try to figure out how to fix my phone or at least to cache the map.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17333602178" title="Traditional Dutch Pancakes by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8879/17333602178_1f965387dc_z.jpg" width="474" height="640" alt="Traditional Dutch Pancakes"></a></p>

<p>The Google wasn&rsquo;t helpful with answers about what I should do. Except for step-by-step instructions where to find the languages. Which wasn&rsquo;t helpful as settings application wasn&rsquo;t working. In the end I was able to fix my phone. Not really sure why or how, but I was glad for settings application to start working allowing me to go back to English language. The fix was kind of simple. Inserted my original SIM card which doesn&rsquo;t work outside my country, but I&rsquo;m guessing the &ldquo;virus&rdquo; figured it was not able to do his thing and just left. Or something along those lines. It&rsquo;s a mystery to me. I was just glad for it to start working the way it&rsquo;s supposed to work. Except for antivirus being in English which I was able to change only after about a month.</p>

<p>Back in full gear went to look for that park again. Small, but nice park. As long as you don&rsquo;t step into any dog shit that is. Decided it&rsquo;s time to visit the Vondelpark park. It was the weekend and streets can get noisy from all the tourists who come to be loud, be stupid, be drunk, be unhappy and be back in 9-to-5 job on Monday. Don&rsquo;t get offended if any of those describe you. <em>I don&rsquo;t have anything against having some fun (choose your own definition)</em> or anything like that, I just don&rsquo;t think that because it&rsquo;s the weekend and you went to another country it allows you to be an idiot. <strong>I know common sense is dead, but try to find it</strong>.</p>

<p>The Vondelpark is wonderful. It&rsquo;s a large area with green zones, water and all kinds of people in it. If the day is sunny &amp; warm it&rsquo;s perfect to just lie down and relax, maybe with a book, maybe without one. It takes a while to walk through whole park, especially if you get lost as roads can sometime get confusing (they are wiggly). It has public toilets, refreshments (you can always bring your own), benches. It should take care of most of your needs. You will also meet some &ldquo;strange people&rdquo;, I call them &ldquo;crackers.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t know why but this is what comes to my head then I think about them (in the voice of Eddie Griffin). I met three different categories during my two weeks. The first one being friendly ones which talk with you about something and  after a bit asks if maybe you could share some coins. The second one was similar to friendlies except I call them idiots. I try to be positive, but when you tell me about how hard their life is and they have no money for food because he wasted couple hundred euros yesterday in casino. Sorry, this is were I draw the line and walk away. I&rsquo;m not good enough yet to deal with this kind of situations. The third one are the aggressive kind and best to avoid as it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if one of them stabbed you (I have good imagination).</p>

<p>Before leaving the park stopped to listen to one guy playing incredible jazz music. Liked it so much that stopped to listen to it while talking with his friends. They were from Chile and damn, their language is beautiful. A bit later two other people stopped to listen to music and join the conversation. After a while a new guy mentioned that if someone wants Marilyn Monroe LSD he has some to sell. I would guess it would be an easy way to spice up my birthday and after listening to Tim Ferriss podcast I sometimes wonder that it would be a positive experience to experiment a little with psychedelic drugs. The thing is that some risks I like to take in the controlled environment. <em>Taking who knows what, with who knows who, who knows were for me personally isn&rsquo;t that comforting or something I couldn&rsquo;t live without</em>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>&ldquo;Why are you going to Amsterdam if you don&rsquo;t smoke?&rdquo;</em> A question from my friend before leaving, makes me smile every time I remember it. If you came here looking for some crazy juicy stories from Amsterdam, keep looking. I&rsquo;m sure a lot of (young) people go to Amsterdam exactly for sex, drugs &amp; alcohol. I chose to explore the other side of it: beautiful city, great culture &amp; museums.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what the series are about you can read the <a href="/testing-world-series-intro">intro</a>.</p>

<p>A few months before my birthday I was starting to think what I should get myself for it. It&rsquo;s not like I care a lot (any) about my birthday. It&rsquo;s just what most of the time I can remember what is the date so it&rsquo;s easy to assign some crazy gift/event with it (like testing operation table for the first time or quitting my job). The runner was to get a tattoo. I don&rsquo;t like or understand tattoos, but it would be another thing I done in life. Wondering that kind of tattoo? A black dot (probably below my belly button) and if someone would ask what it means (tattoo must have a meaning) the reply would be &ldquo;I dot F&hellip;ing give a S..t&rdquo; (aggressive, but effective). Then I remembered my promise to return to Amsterdam for at least a week. The first time I visited I was acting like some stupid tourist (going through shops, etc.) and it was only for half a day. From the map it looked like a great city with a lot to see. We have a winner!</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time trying to decide what kind of a trip it should be. First was thinking about traveling around whole Netherlands (it happened in a way, but you will read about it at the end). After some calculations decided to just take two weeks off, working as little as possible and just stay all that time in Amsterdam. Tickets purchased, places booked, map marked with places to visit (didn&rsquo;t think about keeping it so can&rsquo;t share it). Only need to wait until the end of June.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17521426095" title="Packed &amp; ready to go by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7683/17521426095_e7069aa254_z.jpg" width="637" height="640" alt="Packed &amp; ready to go"></a></p>

<p>Few hours later after a strangely pleasant flight (don&rsquo;t like them) was back in Eindhoven. A few years ago I lived in this city for a few weeks through ERASMUS. You can take the bus or the train to the Amsterdam. It costs about the same and it takes about the same amount of time. The bus is near the airport exit, but it looked like you should have a printed ticket for that (maybe someone knows if you can buy the ticket from a driver?) so just decided to use the train. At the same time I would grab something to eat at city center. While reading a cafe menu almost got hit by a car. <em>A great way to start your holidays/trip is on the front hood of a car as an ornament</em>. Maybe I lost my appetite or maybe the menu didn&rsquo;t had anything tasty and decided to try to reach Amsterdam before some other car tried to take a bite out of me.</p>

<p>Before you arrive to Netherlands &ndash; get a lot of € coins, a lot, like at least 20€ worth of coins. Why? You need them to buy the bus/train tickets and no one has any coins. You could pay with a debit/credit card, but I was against that as you get a 2% charge for paying with a card. Also I try to avoid having my card while trying and keep it at the place I&rsquo;m staying. <em>If I loose my wallet with the money in it I just lost my money, I can always get more at the ATM. If I loose my wallet with the card in it I&rsquo;m just left with that I have in cash. Just a safer choice in my opinion</em>. You can buy a ticket from the office with an extra charge. Now that I think about it the price is probably the same in the end.. Still stupid.. Forgot to add that some places accept only cash, some places accept only cards and some places I&rsquo;m not even sure accepts anything. I work with technology, I know it fails. What do you do when you can&rsquo;t accept card payments? Tell everyone to F&hellip; off and close down the shop? Well in short just <strong>know what you will be charged for paying with a card and always check which payment methods are available</strong>.</p>

<p>The trains have a free WiFi allowing you to contact your host about your arrival, search for information or just read the articles. Which I did as the first half part of the trip is boring. The second half starts where the sea should start so it&rsquo;s more interesting to look at the canals and ships. I have planed my way from the train station, but the more I looked at the map the more doubts I had about reaching it. Must be my paranoia, I&rsquo;m sure it will turn around somewhere and I will go to the train station. At least I thought so until the voice over the speakers went &ldquo;This is the last stop, please get out&rdquo;, crap. So, I&rsquo;m in the Schiphol airport. WiFi is not working anymore. Everything is in Dutch and I have no idea which bus goes to the city center. I guess I could always walk to it, it&rsquo;s only one screen away, the same distance as if walking to America. All the thoughts were gone once I found the tour mini-bus which was giving information about how to get to the city and selling the tickets.</p>

<p>While studying the map provided with the ticket I was starting to get doubts again about reaching the train station (<em>it can be confusing until you get your bearings around any new city</em>). Decided to just risk it and get out at what looked the closest stop to the place of my stay. Made the right choice and got out on the street I needed. The sun was shining and atmosphere was refreshing. It&rsquo;s nice to be back in Amsterdam, this city does have something special.</p>

<p>That I love about traveling and booking your places through airbnb is what you can try some interesting houses without having to make a long term commitment. My first house &ndash; a house boat. Even if it&rsquo;s only for one day (it had some maintenance issues) it&rsquo;s a new experience. Somehow I missed checking the rest of the photos of my host and was expecting some tall guy. The door opens and I see someone who looks like Mr. Chow from Hangover movie, even his voice was similar. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Andrew? Hi, you look different than in your photo. Come in, sorry, I&rsquo;m still hangover from yesterday, come in come in.&rdquo; After all the formalities of explaining rules and suggestions, I looked around and took a big breath of air overflowed with excitement. It&rsquo;s strange when you look out the window and water is like only a hands length away and when a big fleet of ducks start swimming your way for their payment of food. Can&rsquo;t even remember it without smiling. Another strange thing is tourists swimming in boats past your window, especially when you&rsquo;re peeing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/16728375584" title="Testing the World and Looking for Home - Intro to series by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7745/16728375584_736018f7be_c.jpg" width="800" height="400" alt="Testing the World and Looking for Home - Intro to series"></a></p>

<p>I have a &ldquo;strange&rdquo; approach / thinking about everything. I <strong>never understood putting imaginary walls like countries / borders / nationality / etc.</strong> To me it always looked strange. <em>Why someone would be willing to cram in himself into some imaginary box</em>. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I understand what culture, country you grew up, nationality defines you and could have a high impact on how you might react to things. But my answer to &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; is &ldquo;From Earth, last time I checked?&rdquo; (I have some doubts, but lets leave it at that). I&rsquo;m also not someone who will just pack his backpack and would go on the round the world trip (at least not yet). Damn, about a year ago, listening to someone&rsquo;s latest trip would suck out the energy from me.</p>

<p><strong>Staying in another country in my opinion is something you have to do as soon as possible</strong>. No matter how much you read, it won&rsquo;t <em>expand your thinking</em> as mush as surrounding yourself with a different culture &amp; environment. Today, when you have so much opportunities to travel, <em>it&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t miss out on</em>.</p>

<p>As a digital nomad I have a great opportunity to travel as long as I have my laptop and internet connection. Even internet is not a requirement. My current approach is to visit the country for a few weeks or months, learn about the culture and life in that country and return to my &ldquo;base of operations&rdquo; country. A lot of people would suggest that you should stay 3 months in one place or at least a month, and I agree with you, but I also found that for me 2 weeks is great. It allows enough time to get a feel for a place, but it&rsquo;s not that long in case you won&rsquo;t like it. My &ldquo;base of operations&rdquo; country is the one I grew up and quite used up to. But it&rsquo;s not the country I would like to live for the rest of my life. Before, I used to hate it. As I traveled more and my thinking expanded the thinking about it changed and just like any country it has pros and cons. One of the pros is that it&rsquo;s relatively cheap to live in, allowing to save that money for the next trip.</p>

<p><strong>So what is my main reason for traveling? It&rsquo;s to find a place which I could call my home</strong>. <em>You know what feeling where thinking about some place makes you warm inside and you can&rsquo;t wait to return to it</em>. Some might say the home is the place which you make, and you would probably be right, but as long as I&rsquo;m able I will first try to find that place. At least failing to find that place would help me into understanding what I&rsquo;m really looking for.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done a lot of traveling yet. But thought that some might find it useful to learn what I learned through my travels. <strong>The purpose of the series is to share what I liked, disliked and general tips about places visited</strong>. <em>It&rsquo;s always good to be wise and learn from other people mistakes, but never forget to make your own</em>.</p>
