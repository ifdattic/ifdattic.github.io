    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If I notice something to be continuously mentioned, it might have some truth to it. When looking into that top performers (like <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/02/02/arnold-schwarzenegger/">Tim Ferriss, Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, etc.) do, most of the time the meditation is mentioned. <strong>As I would like to be top performer after I grow up meditation is something I want to have as a habit</strong>. Had a powerful experience once so know it can be a powerful tool.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/18736614889" title="Review of ZivaMind Meditation Course by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/308/18736614889_f916ca658e_z.jpg" width="640" height="320" alt="Review of ZivaMind Meditation Course"></a></p>

<p>The problem is what I&rsquo;m <strong>having problems finding one which would work for me</strong>. Most of them are spiritual. With some hairy guru, flowers and other elements which should bring peace &amp; bliss. For me the line between spiritual enough &amp; too spiritual is thin. I have nothing against it &amp; I&rsquo;m happy if it works for other people. For me, it makes me cringe. Just like the word God. (I like using it when cursing. Don&rsquo;t put any weight to it as it means nothing to me. Might throw away a great book just for using that word too much.) To give some anchor point to me even <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace application</a> is too spiritual. Just can&rsquo;t stomach that guru voice, it&rsquo;s me not you.</p>

<p>Another problem is what I always <strong>had problems keeping meditating for long</strong>. Would start strong, do it every day for a week or two. Then I will have a day or few where &ldquo;<em>I have no time</em>&rdquo; for it. Or the cheating will start making it more like a nap.</p>

<p>One day watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC7a_gQB9YQ">Google talk with an Emily Fletcher about meditation</a>. Maybe her &ldquo;positivity&rdquo; was a bit too much. I don&rsquo;t like that in people. Think it&rsquo;s because if you took a scalpel deep enough into my brains you will find it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m not like that &amp; would love to be. A lot of points in the talk made sense to me.</p>

<p>After looking more into what Emily does decided to try her <a href="http://www.zivamind.com/">ZivaMind meditation course</a>. <strong>If you fail, try again</strong>.</p>

<p>The course isn&rsquo;t cheap (250$ at the time of purchase). But it&rsquo;s only if it wouldn&rsquo;t work, if it works that price would be a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s delivered in 8 days with some extras added</strong>. Some of the days you&rsquo;re asked to answer few questions to bring your awareness. Don&rsquo;t think that you only need 8 days to become a master and start flying around on your bliss. This is the time you will need to consume the lessons to be in position to continue the meditation practice by yourself. After 8 days you might still have a lot of questions. A lot of them are answered in a recorded call(s) (day 9 of course).</p>

<p>The great thing about the course I liked is that <strong>it almost has no spiritual stuff</strong>. It has the mantra which I will put in spiritual category. I don&rsquo;t mind it so much as it&rsquo;s used as a tool to anchor yourself when you start wondering too much. Found it helpful.</p>

<p><strong>I like delivery of course a lot</strong>. Like explaining that you don&rsquo;t need to do it for hours or become a monk to reap the benefits of meditation. It helps to calm yourself knowing that 15 minutes twice a day is something you can do. Of course if it won&rsquo;t work then meditation is out the window as becoming a monk won&rsquo;t help either. <strong>Showing how a meditation session might look is very helpful</strong>. After seeing it you stop beating yourself that you&rsquo;re doing it wrong or you will never be able to do it right or you think too much, etc.</p>

<p>The website application of the course could be better. For someone who works in web &amp; cares about security, receiving his password in email can lead to a heart attack. It doesn&rsquo;t remember that I have logged in so every day requires me to log back in.</p>

<p>A new day of meditation is enabled every 24 hours. Which I understand but don&rsquo;t think is a good choice. I think it would be better if a new one was made available after 16 hours. For first few days it wasn&rsquo;t an issue. After that I started waking up early and a new day wasn&rsquo;t available to me. Just make the change on the application, it&rsquo;s fine if mails are sent every 24 hours. And if someone is counting the end of 16 hours just to check the new video they have bigger problems.</p>

<p>One of the days contained a video about space. Have no efing idea what it was about or what it has to do with meditation. Some spiritual thought provoking time &ndash; yes, but I would rather it was not added.</p>

<p>In one video you&rsquo;re taught a breathing technique to help you meditate. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t do it. As someone who has only one nostril working most of the time, anything breathing related is uncomfortably painful. If you have never drowned, choked, suffocated &mdash; yes, I&rsquo;m that good at accidental suicides &mdash; it would be hard to explain the feeling.</p>

<p>The course provides audio files to help meditate for various reasons: sleep, travel, performance. They are helpful, but from that I noticed they have white noise during silent periods which makes it hard to concentrate. It could also have lite versions which contained less explanations (explanations are good for beginning). <strong>The video version of 15 minute meditation I found very helpful</strong>. Most of it is silence, but that I liked about them is that I don&rsquo;t have to keep eyes on the clock. Having a timer application running is not a problem. It&rsquo;s just a better quality meditation if I keep my eyes closed through it. It would be great if audio version of this was available (without white noise).</p>

<p><strong>The suggestion to use the last few minutes of meditation for gratitude is great</strong>. I have a habit of being grateful for 3 things each day, big or small. Makes you appreciate your life &amp; what you have a lot more. Those few minutes were I run through all the things that happened &amp; I&rsquo;m grateful for makes me even happier.</p>

<p>I just started the course &amp; need to keep it for longer to know if it works. So far my thoughts are positive and feeling good with sticking with it. Doubt that I will find anything better &amp; if it won&rsquo;t work then the problem is somewhere else. <strong>If like me you have problems with making meditation a habit I would suggest to try out the <a href="http://www.zivamind.com/">ZivaMind meditation course</a></strong>.</p>

    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/review-nodejs-right-way-book"/>
    <updated>2014-12-25T15:08:52+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://ifdattic.com/review-of-node-dot-js-the-right-way-book</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51+VjuSvKJL._SL250_.jpg">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51+VjuSvKJL._SL250_.jpg</a>" title="&lsquo;Node.js the Right Way Book Cover&rsquo; &lsquo;Node.js the Right Way Book Cover&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of learning something new. After enrolling into <a href="https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101JS/about">MongoUniversity MongoDB course</a> where all the examples would be in Node.js, decided it would be great time to at least get acquainted with Node.js. Then as the luck would have it, someone tweeted about &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HSO6YD8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00HSO6YD8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=if015-20&amp;linkId=2KSSTQD6Z2X2CDRS">Node.js The Right Way</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/hexlib">Jim. R. Wilson</a>&rdquo; from <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/jwnode/node-js-the-right-way">The Pragmatic Programmers</a>, which is always a great place to look for books. As the ebook version is available on Amazon (screw the discounts, I require my ebooks to be locked into the Amazon ecosystem), I bought it. Now I knew how I will be spending my mornings for a while.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The book is made from the following chapters:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Getting Started</strong> introduces the Node.js event loop, outlines the five aspects of Node.js development and provides instructions you would need for the following chapters.</li>
<li><strong>Wrangling the File System</strong> will help you write your first Node.js program &ndash; using Node&rsquo;s filesystem tools to create asynchronous, nonblocking file utilities.</li>
<li><strong>Networking with Sockets</strong> is were you will create a TCP servers and client programs for accessing them. This chapter will offer insight into Node application design and provide experience creating testable and fault-tolerant systems.</li>
<li><strong>Robust Message-Passing</strong> will introduce you to using third-party libraries. Using ØMQ (ZeroMQ) you will create suites of programs that work together in concert, and you will learn the clustering tools for managing them.</li>
<li><strong>Accessing Databases</strong> introduces databases and how to interact with them asynchronously in Node. The database created in this chapter is the foundation for RESTful APIs you&rsquo;ll be developing in later chapters.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable Web Services</strong> chapter will use Express, a popular Node.js web framework for routing requests. It will introduce objects called promises for managing asynchronous code flows and how to couple them in interesting ways with generator functions.</li>
<li><strong>Web Apps</strong> is the final chapter were you will build a single-page web application for integrating with web services created in previous chapters. In this chapter you will be using Passport module for authenticating with Google account credentials and storing session data in Redis.</li>
</ol>


<p>Each chapter provides some aspects of Node.js development like: Architecture and Core, Patterns, JavaScriptisms, Supporting Code.</p>

<p>A few issues (suggestions) for the book is that code samples could be more concise. It does not take any value away from them, but would just be nicer.</p>

<p>The database chapter requires a dataset which extracts to at least 500 MB (didn&rsquo;t wait for it to finish). My suggestion would be to provide a cropped dataset or simply add a note to kill the extraction at some point (just extract enough to make the examples work).</p>

<p>In my opinion it would be great if book provided a Vagrant or Docker file for having an environment which contains all the required software and working code examples.</p>

<p>The book has a very nice flow. Providing a lot of code examples and giving explanations for each line (block) of code. Still, you should have at least some JavaScript knowledge.</p>

<p>At the end of each chapter, questions and exercises are provided for improving your knowledge of what you learned from the chapter.</p>

<p>If you want to learn Node.js in my opinion this is the great book for that. It would provide you with enough knowledge where you will be confident to start using it in your everyday life and continue learning it through practice.</p>

<p>You can buy it from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HSO6YD8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00HSO6YD8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=if015-20&amp;linkId=2KSSTQD6Z2X2CDRS">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/jwnode/node-js-the-right-way">The Pragmatic Programmers</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/review-of-sql-performance-explained-book"/>
    <updated>2014-07-30T08:36:33+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://ifdattic.com/review-of-sql-performance-explained-book</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the review of <strong>SQL Performance Explained</strong> book by <strong><a href="http://use-the-index-luke.com/about">Markus Winand</a></strong>. The book explains everything developers need to know about the SQL performance. And the only thing that developers need to learn is how to index <a href="http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/06/03/the-problem-is-not-the-tool-itself/">(comic strip explaining it)</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Below is the list of the chapters in a book:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Anatomy of an Index</strong> doesn&rsquo;t cover SQL specifically, but it explains the fundamental structure of an index.</li>
<li><strong>The Where Clause</strong> explains all aspects of the <code>where</code> clause. This is the biggest chapter in the book and after learning the techniques provided, you will be able to write much faster SQL.</li>
<li><strong>Performance and Scalability</strong> is about performance measurements and database scalability. It will explain why adding hardware is not the best solution to slow queries.</li>
<li><strong>The Join Operation</strong> gives explanation about how to use indexes to perform a fast table join.</li>
<li><strong>Clustering Data</strong> explains how to get best performance when selecting only part of columns.</li>
<li><strong>Sorting and Grouping</strong> is about how to use indexes with <code>order by</code> and <code>group by</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Partial Results</strong> explains how to benefit from a &ldquo;pipelined&rdquo; execution if you don&rsquo;t need the full result set.</li>
<li><strong>Insert, Delete and Update</strong> deals with performance when executing write queries.</li>
</ol>


<p>The book is very well written so once you start reading it it&rsquo;s not so easy to put it down. The examples are for Oracle database, but it also covers all other databases (MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL) so any differences or things to know won&rsquo;t be left out for database you&rsquo;re using.</p>

<p>I had this book for a while, but constantly prioritized something else. I was really glad I finally read it and wish I did it earlier. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a novice when it comes to SQL (at least I knew about SQL injections, indexes, etc.), but reading this book really expanded my knowledge about improving my SQL. If you&rsquo;re working with relational databases I would suggest to read this book sooner than later. Other examples are provided in different languages (PHP, Java, etc.), so you won&rsquo;t be left in the dark thinking where to start.</p>

<p>You can buy this book from <a href="http://sql-performance-explained.com/">SQL Performance Explained website</a> or paperback from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Performance-Explained-Everything-Developers-about/dp/3950307826">Amazon</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/review-of-vagrant-up-and-running-book"/>
    <updated>2013-10-15T18:35:14+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://ifdattic.com/review-of-vagrant-up-and-running-book</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449335837/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1449335837&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=if015-20">Vagrant: Up and Running by Mitchell Hashimoto</a>. The book gets you started with using <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>. Vagrant allows you to create environments which can be similar or exactly like the environment your application will run on then it reaches the production stage.<!-- more --> Have you ever had a situation where application works perfectly on your Windows environment, but when you push it to Linux server you get errors, because you have a case typo in your code? Or how about when you need some third-party library and installation on Windows is as simple as building an Eiffel Tower, and even then, documentation says it might not work on Windows? Or maybe you&rsquo;re working on a few projects which require different PHP versions? Sounds familiar? Well, this is where Vagrant is going to help you, especially with &ldquo;<em>works on my machine</em>&rdquo; bugs.</p>

<p>All the bugs described above can really get on your nerves, especially if the deadline is already nibbling at your fingers, and the last thing you need is some bug running around, having a party at your expense. So I was thinking about starting to use manually created virtual machines which have their own cons, so I was putting this away <em>for &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo;</em> for some time. And recently I learned about Vagrant, which sounded like a perfect way to get rid of a couple headaches and work more professionally. I just wish I found about it sooner, because it&rsquo;s very easy to start using it, doesn&rsquo;t take forever to configure, if you mess something up it&rsquo;s easy to start over, and my application will be running on the environment which is the same or similar to the production environment.</p>

<p>So, I was about to hit the Vagrant documentation when I found that this book was available to read an on-line version for free (some kind of promotion or something like that). And because I like reading (and books) which led to this review.</p>

<p>Vagrant: Up and Running is very well written, so it was a pleasure to read it. Most of the time it actually didn&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re reading a technical book, it felt more like you asked a colleague or a friend to teach Vagrant to you (just hope it&rsquo;s not someone like me as I&rsquo;m not very good at explaining, probably should work on that a bit).</p>

<p>The book has clear topics with progressive tasks, code examples, code results and notes. This allows you to read again any topic for reference without the need to re-read a previous topic, but you still need to have a least some understanding of what was done before (it would be hard to provision a virtual machine if you don&rsquo;t know how to start it first). There are also a couple of images to help you along the way. Of course it&rsquo;s nice sometimes to see something else than just a bunch of &ldquo;letter monsters&rdquo;, but in my opinion the chosen images are not that useful (image of two words command, which gives three words output feels a bit like a waste of space/money/bytes/etc.).</p>

<p>If you want to follow the examples when you&rsquo;re reading the book, Internet connection is a must. You can download Vagrant, VirtualBox and a vagrant box beforehand, but as soon as you reach the provisioning of the virtual machine it will be impossible to follow the examples without Internet. Also unless you have a blazingly fast connection, you might want to jump around the book a little bit. If it feels like something that needs to be downloaded is coming up, I would suggest skipping a bit, start the download and go back to continue reading while it&rsquo;s downloading. This way you won&rsquo;t end waiting until it is possible to continue reading.</p>

<p>The book is made from the following chapters:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>An Introduction to Vagrant</strong> &ndash; provides information why you should be using Vagrant, the alternatives to Vagrant, and full installation with setup. The installation is provided for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X so no matter which OS you&rsquo;re using there will be no need for figuring out how it&rsquo;s installed.</li>
<li><strong>Your First Vagrant Machine</strong> &ndash; is where you end running a vagrant machine (two commands &amp; that&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m not lying). Of course the chapter won&rsquo;t leave you hanging. It will provide extensive explanations about <em>Vagrantfile</em> (configuration file), how to configure your machine, and what to do with your machine once the work is done and it&rsquo;s time to relax.</li>
<li><strong>Provisioning Your Vagrant VM</strong> &ndash; explains about virtual machine provisioning (how to do it manually or automatically). An empty running machine probably won&rsquo;t be very useful without needed software so the chapter explains how to provision your machine through <em>SSH</em>, <em>shell</em>, <em>Chef</em>, <em>Puppet</em>. It also has some other information you might need for provisioning.</li>
<li><strong>Networking in Vagrant</strong> &ndash; the chapter is about how to configure Vagrant virtual machine so it could communicate with a host and/or other devices.</li>
<li><strong>Modeling Multimachine Clusters</strong> &ndash; shows how to configure Vagrant to use multiple machines. This is especially useful if you work in the cloud where web/db/cache/etc. is on different machines. This will allow you to get close to your production environment (helping to get rid of &ldquo;works on my machine&rdquo; bugs), and you will be able to test in a controllable environment, what will happen if one of machines goes down.</li>
<li><strong>Boxes</strong> &ndash; is a chapter about Vagrant boxes. You will learn about boxes in general, how to manage them and how to create them from an existing environment or completely from scratch.</li>
<li><strong>Extending Vagrant with Plug-Ins</strong> &ndash; is quite a long chapter about managing and creating Vagrant plug-ins. But unless you know <em>Ruby</em> and think about creating plug-ins, you won&rsquo;t lose (just save a lot of time) anything skipping the whole chapter after the plug-in management section.</li>
<li><strong>Appendix A/B</strong> &ndash; is two appendix chapters giving some information about Vagrant variables for quick reference.</li>
</ul>


<p>The book takes about <em>11 hours</em> to finish. This of course will depend on your reading speed, how long you will play with the code and a couple more things.</p>

<p>Now, would I suggest reading it? I actually not sure.. It&rsquo;s a nice book which I really enjoyed reading, and it will get you up and ready for using Vagrant for your projects, but in my opinion you can easily get it just from reading the documentation. Vagrant documentation is really good, without circling about the same topic for ages, and in couple hours of reading and playing around you would be just as ready to use Vagrant as with the book. Also, something that really got on my nerves while reading the book was that the book wasn&rsquo;t released that long ago, but it uses version 1 of configuration while <code>vagrant init</code> gives you Vagrantfile in version 2. Of course Vagrant is made in a way which allows to use any configuration version together, but it&rsquo;s not fun jumping around (and plug-ins chapter goes with V2, because otherwise it won&rsquo;t work).</p>

<p>Even if a documentation is good enough, you might want to get this book for different reasons. For example if you have some free time while taking a train to work. It would be a great chance to put yourself on &ldquo;<em>the next level</em>&rdquo;. Also, I know a lot of people hate reading ebooks or documentations on-line, so getting a paper book would be a great investment. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love paper books, but just not then the topic is technical, it&rsquo;s just no fun trying to juggle an open book and typing an example at the same time.</p>

<p>That I do know is that if you&rsquo;re a programmer, you definitely won&rsquo;t lose if you will learn Vagrant. Especially when there are services like <a href="https://puphpet.com">PuPHPet</a> which allows you to create virtual machines using a simple GUI.</p>

<p>You can buy this book from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449335837/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1449335837&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=if015-20">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026358.do">O'Reilly</a>.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-02T22:53:41+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://ifdattic.com/review-of-yii-application-development-cookbook-se-book</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the review of <strong>Yii Application Development Cookbook (Second Edition)</strong> book by <strong><a href="http://rmcreative.ru/author">Alexander Makarov</a></strong>. The cookbook covers practical Yii application development tips which will help you develop better applications, and it also has recipes for important Yii features which are very useful to know.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time I read Yii Application Development Cookbook. The first time I read it was then it was still in per-order (the first edition), and because it was such a good book I was already thinking about reading it for the second time after I finish reading <a href="http://yii.larryullman.com/index.php">The Yii Book by Larry Ullman</a> (which by the way you should pre-order, at the end of the review I will explain why). So when I found that a second edition is coming out and got my hands of a review copy I was quite happy.</p>

<p>The book is written by Alexander Makarov who is an experienced engineer from Russia and has been a Yii framework core team member since 2010. He also was the technical reviewer for three other books related to Yii, so you can be sure the cookbook is written by someone who knows inner workings of Yii framework.</p>

<p>The cookbook has a similar format to other PacktPub cookbooks and is easy to follow, but you should have at least a basic understanding on how Yii framework works before starting with recipes (<a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide">The Definitive Guide to Yii</a> is a good place to start). The recipes are split into 13 chapters that will show you how to use Yii efficiently.</p>

<p>Every recipe is split into smaller sections (depending on the recipe some sections might be missing):</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Introduction</em> &ndash; explanation about the recipe, what it solves or any other information that might be needed.</li>
<li><em>Getting ready</em> &ndash; contains instructions how to make this recipe work (e.g., setting up new application or database tables needed for a recipe).</li>
<li><em>How to do it</em> &ndash; is a step by step instructions of recipe code.</li>
<li><em>How it works</em> &ndash; gives a fuller explanation of the recipe code and how it works.</li>
<li><em>There&rsquo;s more</em> &ndash; instructions about how the recipe can be improved or expanded. It also contains URLs for further information about the subject.</li>
<li><em>See also</em> &ndash; a list of similar recipes about the topic.</li>
</ul>


<p>The cookbook contains 90 recipes (if my finger counting is correct) and covers a wide range of topics. Recipes could be categorized in: simple recipes (you&rsquo;re probably already using them), advanced (or good to know) recipes, complex recipes (which will need more fiddling around to completely understand how they work) and recipes which will make you question yourself &ldquo;Why the hell I&rsquo;m not using this in my application?&rdquo;. Some recipes will feel like a duplicates because the topic was more or less covered in another recipe. I also think that a couple more recipes would have made the book a lot more &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; (like a dedicated recipe for caching just a part of your application).</p>

<p>Below is the list of the chapters in a cookbook:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Under the Hood</strong> provides information about the most interesting Yii features. Even if you already have some experience with Yii framework you might not know about them or might not be sure how exactly they work. A couple of features covered in this chapter: events, import, autoloading, exceptions, components, widget configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Router, Controller, and Views</strong> is about how to connect different parts of the framework to make a good application. Recipes will explain how to use pretty URLs, how to write reusable actions, views and other handy things.</li>
<li><strong>AJAX and jQuery</strong> focuses on adding jQuery and JavaScript functionality to your application. The chapter is about Yii specific tricks and will explain how to render the content on the client side, manage assets and a couple more useful things.</li>
<li><strong>Working with Forms</strong> shows how Yii works with forms which is a big part of any application. The chapter will explain how to write custom validators, handle file uploads and create custom input widgets.</li>
<li><strong>Testing Your Application</strong> covers unit testing, functional testing and code coverage reports. Recipes follow a test-driven development approach and will explain how to set your environment and start writing your own tests. This is a very important chapter because as soon as your application starts to grow the chance of breaking something is rising, and it can lead to a lot of problems.</li>

<p>The book takes about 13 hours to finish. This of course will depend on your reading speed, how long you will play with the code and a couple more things.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about learning Yii framework you should definitely buy this book. Even if you already have a good understanding of Yii framework I&rsquo;m sure you will find recipes which will make you even better. Of course if you&rsquo;re just thinking about learning Yii framework you shouldn&rsquo;t start with this book. Here&rsquo;s my suggestion I always give for anyone wanting to learn Yii framework. You should start with <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide">The Definitive Guide to Yii</a> (if you don&rsquo;t feel like investing into a book before you&rsquo;re sure Yii framework is for you) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A9TUK8E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00A9TUK8E&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=if015-20">Web Application Development with Yii and PHP by Jeffrey Winesett</a> or <a href="http://yii.larryullman.com/index.php">The Yii Book by Larry Ullman</a>. I would definitely suggest to get &ldquo;<em>The Yii Book</em>&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s a great book for newcomers to Yii framework. The book is still in pre-order but so far from that I read it&rsquo;s a great book. And a big plus is that your book will be upgraded after it will be updated for Yii 2 version, so you get two rabbits with one stone (because birds are too small for a nice meal). After that you should already have a good understanding about Yii framework and be able to develop applications with it, but to make them really great and get a better understanding of Yii you should read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BKZHDGS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00BKZHDGS&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=if015-20">Yii Application Development Cookbook by Alexander Makarov</a>. Or if you still don&rsquo;t feel like investing into your future as a web developer then you can go start reading wiki articles, documentation and dissecting Yii source code. There is also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATYE3WI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00ATYE3WI&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=if015-20">Yii Rapid Application Development Hotshot</a> book, which I personally haven&rsquo;t read, but my logic puts it as an optional book if you&rsquo;re still not confident enough about starting to develop great applications using Yii framework. Also, Yii framework has a great and friendly community so even if you get stuck somewhere, someone will help you out.</p>

<p>You can buy this book from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BKZHDGS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00BKZHDGS&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=if015-20">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/yii-application-development-cookbook-2nd-edition/book">PacktPub</a>.</p>
