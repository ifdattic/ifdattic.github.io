My name is Andrius Marcinkeviƒçius (or Andrew M. in English, because you can sprain your tongue with a last name like that). I'm a programmer (web developer) mostly torturing my keyboard with back-end development and 
writing. I'm currently residing in Lithuania, but I should move somewhere warmer as the winter is always coming in this country.

I mostly work at back-end development using PHP, MySQL, Symfony framework, Yii framework, AWS. A few examples of back-end projects I did include document registration system for government, integration of internal web service for e-shop, back-end for mobile apps. My skills also include HTML(5), CSS(3), jQuery, Responsive Media Queries so bringing web design to life is not a problem. Maybe not as well as a dedicated front-end developer could do it, but I try to keep with the newest trends and best practices so don't try to 
tell me "*... just use tables to make this layout.*" (but you will get an evil look and a bunch of links how to make layouts in CSS). As long as I don't have to do a design myself, designers can get a heart attack after seeing how "good" I'm at choosing colors. I have a vice of accepting that maybe I already know enough to easily slide through professional life, so I'm constantly immersed in some web service documentation, source code of some great plugin, or tanning in front of my monitor with the book of some programming language. I just can't allow myself to stop learning or miss an interesting challenge.
I also try to give something back to the community by helping other developers, writing tutorials & extensions, fixing and reporting bugs for open source projects. It's a great motivation booster helping others.

It's hard to tell what kind of person I'm, it depends on my mood, people I'm surround with, the temperature outside and a bunch of other small details. Most of the time you'll probably won't notice I'm in the room as I like observing that's going around me and listening. You can learn a lot of interesting things when you listen. I'm also noticed for giving people heart attacks from walking as quietly as a ghost :D I'm also constantly experimenting with my mind and body so me a couple months ago can be very different from me now.

However if I'm in the mood for talking it's something like this: \*imagine\* *the dark night filled with bright twinkling stars in the sky and a lazy fire rolling on the ground. In front of the fire sits an old shaman with a wrinkly face, telling the fairy tales about the vast lands and strange beasts outside the tribes forest line (from time to time throwing some magic dust he bought on eBay for some special effects). In the circle around the fire sits his tribesman and tribeswoman with tribes children sleeping in their laps, listening hungrily for every word the shaman says...*

I'm always on the lookout to learn or try something new, so if you're offering something I haven't tried before, then you already have my attention. This is why I enjoy meeting new people, because every person has a new story to tell and something new to teach me. My head works 24/7 so programming helps me to keep it busy thinking about new ideas and solutions, rather than "*that's the meaning of life*", and all that other mumbo-jumbo. Of course this leads me to constantly scavenging for food (need a lot of energy to keep the wheels in my head turning), and yes, I'm as fat as a skeleton. If vultures saw me in the desert, they will probably bring me some food :D So in the end you have at least two ways to get my attention: offer something new or a hot, homemade meal. Like you probably noticed, I have a little bit strange sense of humor, but it can't be that bad if it puts a smile on someone who's trying not to smile.

On my free time I enjoy taking a long walk (like four or six hours long), relaxing with a nice book or tasty cup of tea, doing something on the extreme" side (jumping with a parachute or visiting a shooting range), and an occasional video game or a movie (at least then the miracle happens and you find a good one). Recently I started to get more into writing, which is not easy, but I'm getting better at it as it doesn't take hours anymore to squeeze at least one sentence. You can also send me a book for review, but it doesn't mean that it will automatically receives praises. I'm a person who tries to tell the truth even if it hurts someones feelings (in other words, don't ask for my opinion if you can't handle the truth).
