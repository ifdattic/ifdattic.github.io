My name is Andrius Marcinkeviƒçius (or Andrew M. in English, you can sprain your tongue with a last name like that). I'm a consultant / programmer with a digital nomad lifestyle, focusing on helping my Clients to solve their problems using technology.

The consultation focus is to bring value to the Client suggesting on ways to lower their expenses, choosing technical stack for their application, making call to action plans for improving quality and security.

The programming focus is to get my hands dirty and go down the rabbit hole making custom applications and APIs. Currently working mostly on back-end using PHP, MySQL, Symfony framework, AWS, MongoDB, Node.js. Previously worked with Yii framework, front-end (HTML, CSS, Responsive Design, etc.), but I try to focus on what allows me to provide most value (back-end). Constantly following trends and learning new things to be able to choose the best tool for the job.

A big believer in Open-Source & sharing knowledge with others.

## Personality

Most of the time closer to the introverted side of the scale, but then needed or feeling like it I can be on the other side of the scale. Trying to live the lifestyle which makes me happiest and most productive.

A big knowledge sponge constantly looking for something new to learn, a good story (from books, people or other media), or some wisdom from Seneca or another philosopher.

I try to focus on values which in my opinion make me a better person. Striving to make sure that the one who went to bed is a better person than the one who woke up. Some of those values are:

* transparency (say how it's even if it hurts);
* happiness;
* learning / self-improvement (kick yourself out of the comfort zone);
* wellbeing (you can't produce the best work if your mind or body are not feeling well);
* servitude (helping others provides more happiness that helping yourself);
* gratitude (to appreciate what you have);
* minimalism / frugality (focus on what is important).

For the dessert, a short essay on how I might look when feeling "social": \*imagine\* *the dark night filled with bright twinkling stars in the sky and a lazy fire rolling on the ground. In front of the fire sits an old shaman with a wrinkly face, telling the fairy tales about the vast lands and strange beasts outside the tribes forest line (from time to time throwing some magic dust he bought on eBay for some special effects). In the circle around the fire sits his tribesman and tribeswoman with tribes children sleeping in their laps, listening hungrily for every word the shaman says...*
