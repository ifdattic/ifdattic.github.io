**Developing applications isn't about programming, it's about improving a business!**

It doesn't matter what latest shining technology your application is using. If it's not solving a business problem then it's just a toy.

I had many opportunities to help businesses solve a problem and add value. Some of them are:

**Document submission application** for a government agency. It allows the clients to submit documents without having to wait in lines. They know what submitted documents will be correct (saving weeks of delay). Agency workers don't need to do time consuming validation anymore (saving hours of time). As soon as the documents arrive they can start filing them.

**Insurance calculator** which allowed employees to get results faster and easier. Customers received a quicker and better quality customer support. This improved their satisfaction and lifetime value.

**Coaching application** for sport teams. Athletes can now access their trainings, progress, schedules on mobile devices. Staff members are able to check the progress of each individual member, making changes as needed. Coaches can make strategies for future games as all information is available for them. An application strengthened a connection between teams members and a staff. Having all information at hand provides faster response times. Performance improvement for each team member and a team as a whole.

**Ticket distribution application** allowing the customers to buy tickets from an event organizer. The application takes care of ticket management and statistics. The client is now able to focus on other aspects of his business.

**Video distribution application** providing encoding, processing, saving and distribution of video content. After upload the application works without any extra input. This allows employees to focus their work on other parts of workflow. When video content is ready it will automatically be available.

Joining existing projects often revealed problems which were ticking time bombs. They are often hard to notice and hidden behind the scene. Leaving them be could lead to spending a lot of money or time to fix their damage. It could even mean having to close down the company and/or facing legal issues.

Here is some of those bombs which might be lurking in your project:

**Auto-generated code** can save a lot of time when developing. But it comes with great responsibility as it can leave security holes. It might **allow public access to business secrets** without having to authenticate. **Blindly copy-pasting** solutions can lead to same problems.

**Leaving security holes** like having *phpMyAdmin* application coupled with your application. Hackers start scanning for vulnerabilities as soon as your application is reachable from online. **Don't think that keeping domain URL a secret will keep you secure!** Don't make their job easier.

Leaving a chance to do **SQL injections** on your application. This is such an old & common issue that you should only read about it in history books. But you wouldn't believe how often it's available for exploitation. What it would do to your reputation if secret data was released to public tomorrow?

Is your application running on optimized infrastructure? Or maybe you're **paying hundreds or thousands for resources which are not used?** Sometimes few hours of optimization is all you need. Don't throw out money which you could invest in improvements.

Would you be able to run your business if all the data was lost right now? This is the risk you take each day **without having backups** of it. Having automated backups lets you sleep easy at night. Losing all data will be only a punch in a face, not a knockout.

Application is growing with features and business is going great. What a wonderful life. Until you start noticing that **new features take longer to put in place**. They **don't work as expected**. Even worse, a **different part of application stops working**! When you ask programmers to fix the issue they act like ghosts. Or you call them after lunch and they tell you they are not coming back, they quit! This is what happens when long term maintenance is collecting dust. **Follow the standards**. **Use version control system**. **Test the code!** Invest more now and some money on long term support.

**Repeating same tasks manually**. Why not spending that time in other parts of the business? How about getting the same results every time? "It's fine, Joe is doing it!" What will happen when he quits or goes to holidays. Will John be able to do the same tasks with same results? **Invest more now and reap the benefits for a long time!**

Having a **not optimized databases**. It might be fine at the beginning of the application to focus on more important things. But as soon as data starts growing it has a big performance hit. Fixing it buy paying for better hardware is a short term solution. Soon no matter how much money you pay the speed increase is minimal. Optimizing the database can reduce costs greatly. **Optimize your infrastructure and performance will shoot up the roof!**

Adding more features to an application is a good investment. Right? It's **not** if these features are never used! Why waste months building something that is not needed? Especially if it only takes a few hours to validate if this feature is needed.

Using **production data for testing**. You want your data in testing to be as close to the one in production. **You don't want to use the real data!** Customers become angry then they start receiving a bunch of test emails. Even worse if their files start disappearing!

**Focusing on wrong things**. You might want that one feature released because you thought of it, or you need it. But the question is if it would be the best feature for business as a whole.
