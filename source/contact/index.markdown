One of my articles could be improved or left you with more questions than answers? Just leave a quick message and I will try to make it more clear.

Maybe you found a bug or some line is impossible to read because of its color? Just point me to the right direction and I will hunt it down and smack some sense to it for bothering good people.

Or maybe you have a great idea in your head which makes you so excited that it's impossible to sleep at night? Of course you could do it yourself, but all that mumbo jumbo about variables, frameworks and servers put you to sleep faster than counting sheep (or maybe you need some management application to know how effective they jumping over the fence is)? Or maybe you're better at different kind of mumbo jumbo like colors, fonts, icons and you need to make it more useful by adding databases, dynamic content and just pure awesomeness? Write me short description about your idea or project and I will see how I can help you.

No? You just wanted to say hello or thanks? That's great, a heartfelt "thanks" or knowing that others appreciate that you are doing gives a nice motivation boost. And you need a lot of motivation in case you decide to rearrange furniture in your room at the middle of the night.
