                            <br />

                            <p>
                                Here are a few real world examples there these values helped my customers:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Using a video course to teach many people on how to convert the ideas in their heads to web applications that solve problems.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Client had a never ending list of features that an application should have. Using my knowledge and expertise of the web, we focused and prioritized most valuable tasks. This allowed client to achieve high ROI and reach profitability faster due to lower development overhead/expenses.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I'm also concerned with helping my clients to develop applications that users love using. Once, I even spent an entire day battle testing an application on a number of Wi-Fi networks across the city to ensure that performance was constant, no matter how slow the network.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Moving fast is important for making a mark in the market share. Unfortunately, each step increases technical depth which starts to slow you down. By optimizing the infrastructure we were able to achieve savings of over $10000 per year. This allowed the client to move fast again and achieve higher profitability.
                            </p>

                            <br />

                            <p class="lead">
                                With each project, before we start coding, we do an extensive road-mapping session in which we define S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-bound) goals for the project.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It is important to define these goals beforehand and to do so based on user behavior and data, as it is more costly in terms of time and money to change the specs once defined.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We continuously and automatically test the developed features to make sure the application behaves properly, and to catch any bugs early. We operate as a lean team, this way we minimize delays and cost.

                                Developing software and business processes with fundamental flaws is costly in terms of time and money, and highly de-motivating for everyone involved.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                By clearly communicating and looking at root-causes as well as user behavior and data, we make a roadmap of what exactly is needed to bring the business to the next level.

                                In terms of programming, most of the work I do is on the back-end, making sure all parts of an application communicate correctly with each other and with external applications, and to make sure data moves and is stored correctly. I use a variety of frameworks, no one size fits all - when planning a project we will determine the best tools for the job on a case by case basis.

                                Most of the projects I work on are non-public and/or under NDA, so I cannot share all details, although I am happy to share contact information of previous clients for references on request.

                                <p>
                                    This is the risk you take without having secure backups - both of user data and of code.

                                <p>
                                    You might be building something no one needs, or for which no market exists.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Focus on features which will bring revenue and users, and validate continuously.

                                <p>
                                    I can help identify "feature creep" and help you implement a routine of human centered design and behavior driven development so you won't build before validation again.
