> **tl;dr; Headbutt the problem and solve it right now as it won't go away**

I stopped (will allow to say "quit" in 10 years) smoking about one year and 7 months ago (2013/08/10). I stopped drinking about 7 months ago (2014/08/15).

Funny thing is on 2013 I was burning a bunch of personal crap (dreadlocks, paintings, clothes, etc). A year later, I'm burning the rest of my personal crap (letters, talismans, diaries, photos, etc.). Remembered that a year before I was doing the same thing and stopped smoking. Thought that it would be great if I stopped drinking after this burning.

It wasn't exactly easy and my though always was to not give any of them away. I liked both of guilty pleasures a lot. Actually, I thought it would be impossible to give them away. But once you challenge yourself you find that "impossible" is just a state of mind. Everything is possible when you don't know it's impossible. Or don't allow yourself to fail before trying.

I'm not against smoking or drinking. I'm not saying I won't start doing it ever again. I do know, I don't want to do them ever again, but I don't know if I'm yet strong enough to keep it forever.

Even writing this article requires a lot of willpower to keep yourself from thinking how delicious is a thick smoke filling your lungs or a cold alcoholic beverage touching the tip of your tongue.

Only my thinking changed - they are the same as crutches are for a healthy person. Most of the time they are only hiding a deeper issue which won't go away. Feeling stressed? Go have a cigarette or a cold beer. Yes, it will get better. For now. The problem is that the issue is still there. Only hidden under a wall which will crumble like  a sand castle.

An believe me, the mind/body plays tricks on you trying to trip you. *"Oh, this is such a perfect problem to have a cold beer over. Let me start you salivating from your mouth."* But if you win and reply with *"No. It won't help with a problem. It won't solve a problem. It won't make me feel any better now or tomorrow and I will still have the same problem the next day. It's time to think how to solve this problem."* This moment is so empowering as you know that you took the hard way out, not the easy one out.

Stopping to drink and/or smoke might have improved my health & finances. But the most important skill it taught me is to **take the hard way out and solve a problem right away, not to hide away from it**.

Have you tried to stop drinking or smoking? Have it taught you anything?
