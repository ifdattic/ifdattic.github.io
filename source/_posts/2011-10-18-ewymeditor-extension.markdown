EWYMeditor is an extension for Yii framework.

This extension is a wrapper for [WYMeditor][wymeditor-homepage] (I only wrote the extension and modifications, not the editor) which is a web-based WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) XHTML editor (not WYSIWYG).

## Features

Here's some of the features provided by extension:

* different ways for adding editor to your forms;
* easy to add plugins;
* powerful and simple XHTML editor.

You can find more information and source code at [GitHub repository][github-extension-page] or [Yii Framework website][yii-extension-page].
