EPrism is an extension for Yii framework.

This extension is a wrapper for [Prism][prism-homepage] by [Lea Verou][lea-verou-homepage] (I only wrote the extension, not the syntax highlighter). *Prism* is a lightweight, extensible syntax highlighter, built with modern web standards in mind. This extension adds this great syntax highlighter using a `widget()` method.

* easy to install and use;
* simple configuration to better suit your needs;
