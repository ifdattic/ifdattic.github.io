EJuiTimePicker is an extension for Yii framework.

This extension is a wrapper for [Timepicker add-on][timepicker-homepage] (I only wrote the extension, not the add-on) which adds a time picker to jQuery UI Datepicker.

## Features

Here's some of the features provided by extension:

* enhance your forms with time, date or date & time pickers;
* a lot of configuration options to better suit your needs;
* support for internationalization and localization (I18N).

You can find more information and source code at [GitHub repository][github-extension-page] or [Yii Framework website][yii-extension-page].
