I have a "strange" approach / thinking about everything. I **never understood putting imaginary walls like countries / borders / nationality / etc.** To me it always looked strange. *Why someone would be willing to cram in himself into some imaginary box*. Don't get me wrong, I understand what culture, country you grew up, nationality defines you and could have a high impact on how you might react to things. But my answer to "Where are you from?" is "From Earth, last time I checked?" (I have some doubts, but lets leave it at that). I'm also not someone who will just pack his backpack and would go on the round the world trip (at least not yet). Damn, about a year ago, listening to someone's latest trip would suck out the energy from me.

**Staying in another country in my opinion is something you have to do as soon as possible**. No matter how much you read, it won't *expand your thinking* as mush as surrounding yourself with a different culture & environment. Today, when you have so much opportunities to travel, *it's something you can't miss out on*.

As a digital nomad I have a great opportunity to travel as long as I have my laptop and internet connection. Even internet is not a requirement. My current approach is to visit the country for a few weeks or months, learn about the culture and life in that country and return to my "base of operations" country. A lot of people would suggest that you should stay 3 months in one place or at least a month, and I agree with you, but I also found that for me 2 weeks is great. It allows enough time to get a feel for a place, but it's not that long in case you won't like it. My "base of operations" country is the one I grew up and quite used up to. But it's not the country I would like to live for the rest of my life. Before, I used to hate it. As I traveled more and my thinking expanded the thinking about it changed and just like any country it has pros and cons. One of the pros is that it's relatively cheap to live in, allowing to save that money for the next trip.


**So what is my main reason for traveling? It's to find a place which I could call my home**. *You know what feeling where thinking about some place makes you warm inside and you can't wait to return to it*. Some might say the home is the place which you make, and you would probably be right, but as long as I'm able I will first try to find that place. At least failing to find that place would help me into understanding what I'm really looking for.


I haven't done a lot of traveling yet. But thought that some might find it useful to learn what I learned through my travels. **The purpose of the series is to share what I liked, disliked and general tips about places visited**. *It's always good to be wise and learn from other people mistakes, but never forget to make your own*.
