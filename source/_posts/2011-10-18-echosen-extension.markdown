EChosen is an extension for Yii framework.

This extension is a wrapper for [Chosen JavaScript plugin][chosen-homepage] (I only wrote the extension, not the plugin) which makes long, unwieldy select boxes much more user-friendly. The extension is very easy to install and can be used on your application just with a single line of code.

## Features

Here's some of the features provided by extension:

* easy to install and use;
* simple configuration to better suit your needs;
* available as jQuery or Prototype plugin.

You can find more information and source code at [GitHub repository][github-extension-page] or [Yii Framework website][yii-extension-page].
