In 2014 I took the 6 weeks trip to Spain. Forgot to record a video of packing my backpack at that moment. After talking with other digital nomads about packing thought that it might be really fun to try recording a video of it. This is the first time I did something like it, so feedback would be appreciated. Here's the video:
