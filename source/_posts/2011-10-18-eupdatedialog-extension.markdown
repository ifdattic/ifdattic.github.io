EUpdateDialog is an extension for Yii framework.

This extension allows to run controller actions using jQuery UI dialog. This allows you to enhance your application making it act more like a desktop applications, which will be appreciated by your users.

<!-- more -->

It is used for extending your application to allow easy CRUD (create-read-update-delete) actions or any other action which returns a proper JSON response. Click event can be added to any link element using a jQuery selector, allowing you to extend your application with additional functionality, without sacrificing design.

Extension degrades gracefully, so your application wonâ€™t lose any functionality if JavaScript is turned off.

## Features

Here's some of the features provided by the extension:

* CRUD actions through AJAX calls;
* degrades gracefully with JavaScript turned off;
* works with grid view widget or links;
* no inline JavaScript needed;
* works with or without CSRF validation;
* a lot of configuration options to better suit your needs;
* i18n (Internationalization and localization).
