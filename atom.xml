    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looking at the map of Barcelona it might look boring as it&rsquo;s only vertical and horizontal lines. This does have a few pros. One of them is that it&rsquo;s easy to navigate. Just choose your direction (you might even have something high for a placeholder) and just zig-zag your way to it. This allows you to choose a more beautiful way, if you find a nice street with lots of trees, just follow it until you have to turn or it ends. Another great thing is that if you need something (pharmacy, market, restaurant, etc.) and you missed one, just keep on going. After a minute or two you will have another one, and after few more minutes another one and so on.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24208103775/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="9"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1474/24208103775_03b449e2ff_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="9"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This time I moved close to La Sagrada Familia. It&rsquo;s a great placeholder for finding where you live. But as a pragmatic person I can&rsquo;t understand the point of building four walls and a roof for centuries. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; or not &ldquo;beautiful,&rdquo; but I just don&rsquo;t get a point of it. Looking at the map this might look far from the center of the city, but it&rsquo;s not so bad. An hour of walking and you reach the beach, it also allows to explore other sides of Barcelona. The view from the window wasn&rsquo;t that great (which happens for most of Spain due to architecture), but it was an improvement.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t trust the good weather and just go around the city in your t-shirt. I got a cold and next couple weeks weren&rsquo;t that fun. After that day I always went out with a thin jacket and a scarf, even if it was 27+ °C outside. I just rolled up my sleeves, except on the beach were I took clothes off to get some sunshine on my skin.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/23840249369/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="32"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1467/23840249369_2791d37c5a_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="32"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>During my Amsterdam trip I tried to visit at least one museum/attraction a day, and I enjoyed that. I don&rsquo;t know if I had enough of them for a while or for some other reason, but I was really disappointed in the museums/attractions in the Spain. I had marked all the places which looked like they might be interesting. After visiting a few (aquarium, chocolate museum, some others I can&rsquo;t remember), I defaulted to doing that I love &ndash; walking randomly around. A lot of places to see are churches which from religion standpoint I&rsquo;m not that interested in (my religion is believing in myself), and from architecture standpoint it doesn&rsquo;t wow me so much. As for other places, you pay for quite expensive tickets, spend some time around, and leave thinking that it might have been more interesting to burn that money. After a few experiences like that I abandoned the idea of visiting museums/attractions.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24208095045/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="24"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1617/24208095045_78d3885522_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="24"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My choice is to try (not always successfully) to stay in the moment and enjoy the moment without trying to photograph every single step (I allow myself to take up to 10% of that I would want to take a photo of) or visiting every single place. Choose quality over quantity. Most of my time was spent walking from the place I lived down to the beach, reading a few articles on the grass by the beach, then walking through the beach enjoying the sand between my fingers, listening to the waves, doing some people watching, and returning back to my place through some random streets.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/23579891124/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="20"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1568/23579891124_6e1458806c_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="20"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m trying to choose where to go, most of the time I just open the map, look for big areas of blue or green color and start moving toward them. From where I was staying it was a great chance to explore the north side of Barcelona which has a lot of green in the map. During random walks I ended up at the Park Güell, which is made from a paid and free parts. My suggestion, just skip the paid part. Why? It costs a lot, you have to wait for a long time before you can enter, there&rsquo;s nothing to see, you can see everything in 5 minutes, and you can see the most of it from the free part of park. As I had a few hours before my admission my choice was to explore the free part of the park, which was a lot of fun. At first following the trails, exploring the plants, and enjoying the view from the higher places. Then starting to climb higher, walking into random directions, enjoying the adventure (add some imagination and you might as well be walking through some forest). One thing you have to watch while doing this is squatting people with bulging eyes and not stepping into someone&rsquo;s squatting results.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24100049952/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="26"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1587/24100049952_14a24dc13c_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="26"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>During another random walk I visited Parc del Laberint d&#8217;Horta which costs less than a few euros, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth at least 10. The only place were I was happy to pay (I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m cheap, I just don&rsquo;t like to pay for something and receive no value in return). After entering it you&rsquo;re so overwhelmed with greenery that even an audio book is not needed, all that nature is enough. At first it&rsquo;s hard to decide which path to choose, but they more or less are connected and you can just take one of them. I chose to go to the right and more or less zig-zaging my way around and climbing up, imagining from time to time to be attacked by a wolf or some other beast just for more fun. Unfortunately, the park administration has decided on how high you can climb and it&rsquo;s a bit disappointing to run into a fence. Still a lot to explore.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24125501281/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="28"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1545/24125501281_bd4e370968_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="28"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember how long I spent in that park, but I do know I walked every place I was allowed to visit, circling back and revisiting some places few more times. Found a pond which looked like a perfect setup for a photo. Sitting for at least half an hour, looking at the turtle, trying to decide if it was a real or a fake one.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/23840250839/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="30"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1620/23840250839_9aeb31da3f_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="30"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Before leaving visited the labyrinth. Can&rsquo;t say I was impressed with it, as it had some holes in the wall from missing greenery (maybe because it was before being closed for maintenance), and it was too noisy taking away a lot of excitement that you might be alone in a never ending labyrinth. At least until I ended at the dead end thinking &ldquo;OK, it&rsquo;s not as bad as I though.&rdquo; Then hitting another dead end &ldquo;How the hell did that happen, I just came from here.&rdquo; Still not as great as it could be and it was least exiting place for me in that park. PS: do you know how to find the exit from the labyrinth?</p>

    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/making-video-course-reflection"/>
    <updated>2016-04-12T12:53:48+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://ifdattic.com/making-a-video-course-behind-the-scenes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is my reflection on creating a video course. It contains personal thoughts, processes used &amp; possible improvements for them. This might be helpful if you&rsquo;re thinking about creating a video course and not sure that it might require or where to start. And if you want to learn how to convert your ideas to web applications you can check the <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/web-development-nodejs-and-mongodb-video">course</a> itself.</p>

<p>First when I got an offer to produce a video course my reaction was to do what I often do &ndash; run &amp; hide (something called impostor syndrome).</p>

<blockquote><p>Impostor syndrome is a term referring to high-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a &ldquo;fraud&rdquo;. Despite external evidence of their competence, those exhibiting the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of course you start making excuses for it &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know enough, I don&rsquo;t have time, etc. &mdash; in the end they are still only excuses. No one ever did something great just by making excuses. By remembering a saying <em>&ldquo;Experts are experts because they started before they knew enough&rdquo;</em> &amp; confirming that it&rsquo;s something I can do (even if it will require banging the head against a wall once in a while).</p>

<p>So, what do you do when you have a project with the deadline &amp; have no idea how long it will take? You procrastinate of course! Like by making a calendar with inner deadlines, and then making a second version as you notice an issue. It&rsquo;s easy to avoid work when you don&rsquo;t know anything about it. The issue with that is that you took the challenge, and sooner or later it will start staring you in the eyes. The question is whose ass kicking will commence.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/26115403990/in/dateposted-public/" title="01 - procrastinating, deadline calendar"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1714/26115403990_b194e22121_c.jpg" width="672" height="800" alt="01 - procrastinating, deadline calendar"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>The secret is inertia</strong>. No matter how scary the task is you can endure it for half an hour. After half an hour you know more about it &amp; another half an hour doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad. In a few days you get a better idea of that it will require from you and you get high from being an ass kicker.</p>

<p>I always enjoyed learning something &amp; teaching it to others. The issue with that is that it requires a lot of reading and experimenting. Kept noticing myself falling in the trap of &ldquo;just one more page&rdquo;, which is bottomless. At some point you have to stomp down your foot &amp; say &ldquo;enough!&rdquo; It gets easier after a while as you start time-boxing it &amp; cutting down research (at least initial) to few hours.</p>

<p>After the research comes the writing. You stare at the cursor on the empty display &amp; have no idea what to write about. 500-700 words looks like Mount Everest as you stare at the excitedly blinking cursor at its starting position.</p>

<p>At this point you go back to inertia. Using the structure from a provided template you try to write down the problem, the solution, and three steps to move between them. This gives you a few anchor points &amp; keyboard starts getting some exercise. After a little bit you look at the word count &amp; swear. You went past 700 words, by a lot. And you still have a bunch to write about.</p>

<p>It might be fine in un-official atmosphere (especially with a drink in hand), but <strong>the secret is quality, not quantity</strong>. You just reached a point most creative people dread &ndash; killing your babies. You spent a lot of time &amp; energy making it, you can&rsquo;t just get rid of it. It would be wrong! Wrong, I say! This is where you have to <strong>punch your ego to the face</strong>. You have to understand that you are doing this to help others, not to make yourself feel better. As the ego runs away with the tail between its legs &amp; you start deleting words, the smile comes to your face as you notice that the message you are trying to convey is becoming easier to understand (and yes I noticed that this sentence goes on forever).</p>

<p>After a while <strong>you get better at writing</strong>. Most of the time you still start with a blinking cursor on an empty page, stumble around till you find the direction you want to go, and try to avoid ending in a ditch too often.</p>

<p>The challenge might have been a lot harder if I was at it alone (and quality wouldn&rsquo;t be as good). By getting support from other people (reviewers, editors, etc.), it&rsquo;s much easier to notice that can be improved or what to do next. The process wasn&rsquo;t always going smoothly as you would like. It doesn&rsquo;t help being an old grumpy man who runs on logic &amp; works in software development. It is only so many times you can fill same information in different format documents before you shout &ldquo;this needs to be an application!&rdquo; Some decisions logically didn&rsquo;t make sense to me. Like asking if I have no days off planned so we could finish the course sooner (answer No). Then after a week of silence (during which I couldn&rsquo;t continue without feedback on existing work) getting a reply about getting back from holidays. Even if multiple people work on the course the distance between them feels enormous. You get feedback on your work, but getting repeated feedback on some point (e.g., elaborating on the comment) feels like dredging through the pitch black silence. And like everywhere there&rsquo;s always some issues with payments. They were trivial, but still I find it strange, as in my opinion finances are the thing you take care right away so you could go back to doing the business which brings in the money.</p>

<p>In the beginning it took a while to get myself rolling. So that calendar with the deadlines came in handy. You could of course just mark the dates on digital calendar, but for me personally it doesn&rsquo;t work as well as taking a deliberate action and getting feedback (like crossing the date and seeing that tomorrow is the deadline). At points, I remembered the words from <em>The Shinning &ldquo;&hellip; All work and no play makes &mdash;&ndash; a dull boy &hellip;&rdquo;</em> My roommates probably wouldn&rsquo;t have liked that scenario. At other times it reminded me of school/college &ndash; doing some assignment for which I will be graded. Can&rsquo;t say I liked that feeling. Mostly, because I didn&rsquo;t like school/college as they interfered with me learning things.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/26115405600/in/dateposted-public/" title="05 - being chased by the deadline"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1692/26115405600_a0fd711a92_c.jpg" width="592" height="800" alt="05 - being chased by the deadline"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I did start making great progress once I got myself rolling. Batching the tasks helped a lot. During writing I kept to focusing on a single topic at a time. Which sounds like a smart decision in theory, but didn&rsquo;t work well in practice. It might be hard to notice, but context switching does take its toll. Once I <strong>started taking hours/days for same tasks</strong> (research, writing, editing, recording, video editing) <strong>time savings became noticeable</strong>.</p>

<p>Trello was used for project management &amp; it worked well. This is kind of DIY project management. But that works well for one project might not be good for another one. All that you really need is to note some tasks, know in which state they are and keep some relevant info.</p>

<p>Doing a video in a single swoop isn&rsquo;t for me &amp; it often ends in a big mess. For that reason, I chose to split everything in smallest possible pieces &amp; then glue them together for the final result. It made batching tasks, recording &amp; editing a lot easier. Of course, the final result is not as natural, and sometimes can feel &ldquo;robotic.&rdquo; The process was kept simple &ndash; scripts in text files under version control, moved to word templates with screenshots, audio in many files, lots of screenshot images, single screenflow recording for each topic (if doing again would probably use many recordings).</p>

<p>One of big parts of making a video course is audio. With my current housing situation it wasn&rsquo;t easy to do. First, for good quality you need good set-up (good microphone, unobstructed lungs, good sound isolation, not being ill, etc.). It&rsquo;s not easy to keep up your cool when dogs start to bark and people start walking around just as soon as you start recording. Good thing that it was decided to add voice over &amp; my audio was only needed for reference, so quality wasn&rsquo;t as important. Another issue with audio recording is that English is not my native language, and I&rsquo;m not a big user of my voice. If it&rsquo;s one of the days where I don&rsquo;t feel like wasting my voice, I can easily spend whole day around people doing chores/errands without saying a single letter (sometimes for fun I just challenge myself with this to see how creative I will get). It was a good practice even if some days the tongue wasn&rsquo;t cooperating. An iodine spray (or something similar) helps a lot as your throat will hurt when recording for long periods. The sentences with a lot of &ldquo;s&rdquo; letters was fun as I started to sound like a snake :D</p>

<p>One thing worth deciding while/before writing scripts is how the commands will be spelled. It&rsquo;s not a problem with simple single word commands, but once they contain dashes/colons, or you start using flags/options, it can be very awkward to convert them to audio. I think, for the next time I will go with making them sound as human as possible (without dashes or anything fancy), and would mention them as little as possible. Maybe say it for the first time or explain a new option when it&rsquo;s used, but otherwise leave it to the video to show the command. Using &ldquo;execute the following command&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t work as well as you would think &amp; in my opinion worth to avoid using. <strong>Avoid using exact numbers</strong> (like <code>13 ms</code> or version <code>3.3.10</code>). Might be fine in some cases, but you want to avoid running tests multiple times just to hit that 13 ms execution time which is used in the script &amp; audio. If you want to make it specific try to <em>use less / greater than with a good margin</em> (e.g., less than a second).</p>

<p>After learning that a voice over will be used felt hurt for a moment; starting to get angry macho voices inside. This is where you have to punch your ego in the face again. Once you do that you realize that this is being done to help as much people as possible, not for stroking your ego.</p>

<p>By this time had a script with screenshots, so recording was easier. You always have to <strong>remember to put everything in the recording state</strong> &ndash; set resolution to one which translates to <code>720p</code>, put everything in full-screen, hide that you don&rsquo;t need, etc. It&rsquo;s not fun to record for a while &amp; notice that something is not right. <strong>Make a checklist you go over before recording</strong>. <em>Two screens help</em> a lot as one contains the recording &amp; another the script. You go through each script step planning how the end result will look like &amp; then recording it. Still, can get frustrating when you mess something up or for example get &ldquo;connection lost&rdquo; in the middle of display as bluetooth mouse decided to save batteries. Then you have to go back to known state (which sometimes can be hard), and repeat again, and somehow mess up again. Took a lot of screenshots, before &amp; after each step. The pace of the video is dictated by the audio and you often need video to stay in place. It can be done by using freeze frames from a video, but found it a lot easier to use an image.</p>

<p>Google Drive was used for storing &amp; sharing the files. Found the whole experience terrible. It works well for storage, but just making the damn thing work takes forever. Never ending loading &amp; refreshes until it finally decides &ldquo;OK, now I will work, you can upload&rdquo; (sometimes taking up to half an hour). Lost any will to use Google Drive again.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/26362331236/in/dateposted-public/" title="07 - editing videos"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1704/26362331236_589d19162e_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="07 - editing videos"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The last part is editing, which by this time is easy as all the work was done before hand. So you wake up half past six in the morning, get a cup of tea with a butter, put on the headphones,and start editing. You throw in the audio, add the video accordingly &amp; make improvements often taking a gut guess. Two monitors are very helpful as you do editing on one &amp; script is on another. The only change I would probably do is to batch the export (like before going for lunch). Exporting takes a long time (at least couple minutes for 5 minute video). After the export you need to watch the video to make sure it&rsquo;s correct and make adjustments. By batching those tasks I could do the export while eating and watch them at the end of the day when already tired.</p>

<p>You could go on forever improving &amp; polishing everything, but in the end you have to remember to just fucking ship it.</p>

<p>So, would I do it again? I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m really glad I took this challenge. Learned a lot during those months &amp; it feels awesome being able to help others. But at least right away I don&rsquo;t feel like taking a similar challenge. It&rsquo;s the direction I wouldn&rsquo;t mind going, but first, should experiment with it in small scale to see exactly where to go.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the people who helped me on this journey. Especially Sigita Mikuckytė, who encouraged me to take this challenge by reminding me that I&rsquo;m trying to hide behind the impostor syndrome.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir<span class="o">=</span>/usr/local/bin --filename<span class="o">=</span>composer
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will install Composer in the directory <code>/usr/local/bin</code> (which should be in your path) allowing you to run it from anywhere by using <code>composer</code> command.</p>

<p>If your installation is working correctly you should see the version and available commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To make sure that you&rsquo;re using the latest version of Composer, constantly run the self update:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer self-update
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a name="install-on-osx"></a></p>

<h3>Installing on OS X</h3>

<p>If you use OS X you can install Composer through <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>brew install homebrew/php/composer
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Check the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx">documentation</a> if any of the installation options doesn&rsquo;t work for you (e.g., install locally or on Windows).</p>

<p><a name="adding-dependencies"></a></p>

<h2>Adding dependencies</h2>

<p>To add a dependency your project needs to use the <code>require</code> command with a package name (format <code>&lt;vendor&gt;/&lt;name&gt;</code>) command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer require monolog/monolog
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Signature:</span>
</span><span class='line'>composer require &lt;vendor&gt;/&lt;name&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Signature of adding multiple dependencies:</span>
</span><span class='line'>composer require &lt;vendor&gt;/&lt;name&gt; &lt;vendor2&gt;/&lt;name&gt; &lt;vendor2&gt;/&lt;name2&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This creates the <code>composer.json</code> file (if it doesn&rsquo;t exist), and installs the dependency (including dependencies your dependency depends on).</p>

<p><strong>Avoid changing <code>composer.json</code> file manually</strong>, most of the time the <code>require</code> command is enough to manage dependencies.</p>

<p>To add a development dependency use the <code>--dev</code> flag with <code>require</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer require --dev phpspec/phpspec
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Signature:</span>
</span><span class='line'>composer require --dev &lt;vendor&gt;/&lt;name&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a name="adding-specific-version"></a></p>

<h3>Adding specific version</h3>

<p>The <code>require</code> command <strong>will automatically choose a suitable version</strong> you can use in your project. If you need to provide the specific version of dependency provide it with the package name:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer require monolog/monolog:~1.17.0
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Signature:</span>
</span><span class='line'>composer require &lt;vendor&gt;/&lt;name&gt;:&lt;version&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Version to use can be defined in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>^</code> (caret) operator means <em>any non-breaking version / until major</em> (e.g., <code>^1.2.3</code> is equivalent to <code>&gt;=1.2.3 &lt;2.0.0</code>)</li>
<li>The <code>~</code> (tilde) operator means <em>approximate / increment right most digit</em> (e.g., <code>~1.2</code> is equivalent to <code>&gt;=1.2 &lt;2.0.0</code> or <code>~1.2.3</code> is equivalent to <code>&gt;=1.2.3 &lt;1.3.0</code>)</li>
<li>Read the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md">documentation</a> to learn about other version constraints (exact, range, wildcard)</li>
</ul>


<p>Versions are described using semantic versioning (SemVer) which uses the format <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>. Each of the numbers have a specific meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>MAJOR</code> &ndash; API changes that break backwards-compatibility</li>
<li><code>MINOR</code> &ndash; new features</li>
<li><code>PATCH</code> &ndash; bug fixes</li>
</ul>


<p><a name="removing-dependency"></a></p>

<h2>Removing dependency</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t need the dependency anymore use the <code>remove</code> command to remove it from the <code>composer.json</code> file and directory:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer remove monolog/monolog
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Signature:</span>
</span><span class='line'>composer remove &lt;vendor&gt;/&lt;name&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To remove the development dependency add <code>--dev</code> flag to <code>remove</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer remove --dev phpspec/phpspec
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Signature:</span>
</span><span class='line'>composer remove --dev &lt;vendor&gt;/&lt;name&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a name="initializing-composerjson-file"></a></p>

<h2>Initializing composer.json file</h2>

<p>If you are creating a package or want to fill a <code>composer.json</code> file interactively, use the <code>init</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer init
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will ask you to provide information like package name, description, dependencies, etc. After you provide all the information it will generate a <code>composer.json</code> file.</p>

<p><a name="updating-dependency"></a></p>

<h2>Updating the dependency</h2>

<p>To get the latest versions of the dependencies (also updates the <code>composer.lock</code> file) use the <code>update</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer update
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you want to update only specific packages provide them to the <code>update</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer update monolog/monolog
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Signature:</span>
</span><span class='line'>composer update &lt;vendor&gt;/&lt;name&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Wildcard is allowed to update multiple packages (without listing them):</span>
</span><span class='line'>composer update &lt;vendor&gt;/*
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a name="installing-dependencies"></a></p>

<h2>Installing dependencies</h2>

<p>Use the <code>install</code> command to install project dependencies:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will read the <code>composer.json</code> file and resolve your dependencies. After finishing the installation it will create a <code>composer.lock</code> file, which contains the exact versions installed. This makes sure that the same versions are installed every time the <code>install</code> command is executed.</p>

<p><strong>Commit your application&rsquo;s <code>composer.lock</code> file (along with <code>composer.json</code>) into version control</strong>.</p>

<p>By convention dependencies are installed into a <code>vendor</code> directory, which <strong>should not be committed to version control</strong>.</p>

<p><a name="installing-dependencies-on-production"></a></p>

<h3>Installing dependencies on production servers</h3>

<p>You will want to use a few flags when installing dependencies on production servers:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer install --prefer-dist --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-interaction
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will optimize the dependency installation which is really useful for production servers. It will try to install distribution packages (<code>--prefer-dist</code> flag), won&rsquo;t install development dependencies (<code>--no-dev</code> flag), and generate a classmap for faster autoloader (<code>--optimize-autoloader</code> flag). The <code>--no-interaction</code> flag will make sure that no interactive questions are asked (needed for automated deployments).</p>

<p><a name="autoloading"></a></p>

<h2>Autoloading</h2>

<p>Composer generates a <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> file which automatically loads the classes your project depends on. Just include that file in your PHP script:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="k">require</span> <span class="nx">__DIR__</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="s1">&#39;/vendor/autoload.php&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can change the <code>autoload</code> key in your <code>composer.json</code> file to define the mapping.</p>

<p>If you added new classes you might need to update the autoloader. Use the <code>dump-autoload</code> command to do that:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer dump-autoload
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># For production use</span>
</span><span class='line'>composer dump-autoload --optimize --no-dev
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p><a name="psr4"></a></p>

<h3>PSR-4</h3>

<p>Under the <code>psr-4</code> key you define a mapping from namespaces to paths, relative to the package root. The PSR-4 is the <em>recommended</em> choice for autoloading (avoids having to regenerate the autoloader after adding classes).</p>

<p><strong>Namespace prefixes must end in <code>\\</code> to avoid conflicts between similar prefixes</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition to normal mapping definition, you can define multiple directories, or define a fallback directory:</p>

<h3>PSR-0</h3>

<p>Under the <code>psr-0</code> key you define a mapping from namespaces to paths, relative to the package root. This also supports the PEAR-style non-namespaced convention.</p>

<p><strong>Namespace prefixes should end in <code>\\</code> to avoid conflicts between similar prefixes</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition to normal mapping definition, you can define multiple directories, or define a fallback directory:</p>

<h3>Classmap</h3>

<p>For libraries that do not follow PSR-0/4 you can specify directories or files to search for classes (using the <code>classmap</code> key):</p>

<p><a name="development-autoloading"></a></p>

<h3>Development autoloading</h3>

<p>You should avoid polluting the autoloader in production with classes it doesn&rsquo;t need (like test suite). Using the <code>autoload-dev</code> key you can define classes that should be loaded only in development:</p>

<h2>Creating a project</h2>

<p>The <code>create-project</code> command will create a new project from an existing package. It&rsquo;s the equivalent of doing a git clone followed by installation of dependencies. The command takes the package name and the directory to create it in (optional: provide the version as third parameter):</p>

<p><a name="loading-custom-package"></a></p>

<h2>Loading custom package / replacing existing package</h2>

<p>In some cases you might want to use a custom package. For example you fixed a bug in open source library and while waiting for PR to be merged you want to use the fixed library.</p>

<p>The branch on the forked repository should be prefixed with <code>dev-</code> (e.g., in the repository it will be <code>bugfix</code>, in the <code>composer.json</code> file it will be <code>dev-bugfix</code>). Then change the <code>repositories</code> key in <code>composer.json</code> (in example assume that I forked <code>Monolog</code> and created <code>bugfix</code> branch):</p>

<p>Now after updating the dependency it should replace the original package with a changed one (don&rsquo;t change the package name for override to work):</p>

<h3>Adding / removing repository through CLI</h3>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to manually add repository use the <code>composer config repositories</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer config repositories.monolog vcs https://github.com/ifdattic/monolog
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Signature:</span>
</span><span class='line'>composer config repositories.&lt;name&gt; &lt;<span class="nb">type</span>&gt; &lt;url&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To remove a repository use <code>--unset</code> flag (<code>repo</code> is alias for <code>repositories</code>):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><a name="running-composer-globally"></a></p>

<h2>Running Composer globally</h2>

<p>Sometimes you might want to install some CLI tools globally. Using <code>global</code> command it will allow to install them to the directory defined in <code>COMPOSER_HOME</code> environment variable:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer global require fabpot/php-cs-fixer
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Signature:</span>
</span><span class='line'>composer global &lt;<span class="nb">command</span>&gt; &lt;vendor&gt;/&lt;name&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p><a name="adding-platform-requirements"></a></p>

<h2>Adding platform requirements</h2>

<p>If you need to add requirements for the system you can use platform packages. They are virtual packages of the things that are installed on the system. For example the following snippet requires for PHP 7 to be available:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='json'><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&quot;require&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&quot;php&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;^7.0&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The following platform packages are available: <code>php</code>, <code>hhvm</code>, <code>ext-&lt;name&gt;</code>, <code>lib-&lt;name&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>To get a list of locally available platform packages run:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>composer show --platform
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>You can do a lot more with Composer, but this should take care of most of the use cases while developing.</p>

    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/spain-barcelona-first-impressions"/>
    <updated>2016-02-10T11:23:43+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://ifdattic.com/spain-barcelona-first-impressions-part-2-testing-the-world-and-looking-for-home-series</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even after 6 weeks in Spain I haven&rsquo;t got used to Spanish time. I have no idea when they work, when they sleep or do anything else; I just know it&rsquo;s not compatible with my personal clock. It&rsquo;s refreshing to walk around the city early in the morning without meeting anyone. Maybe I like the idea of the apocalypse where everyone dies or maybe I just like some personal space, but what I do know is that it&rsquo;s fun.</p>

<p>First things first, as I&rsquo;m the person who likes to be prepared the focus is to find the place where I should live. With the GPS cached on my phone and Barcelona being split into little squares it&rsquo;s not hard to follow the streets to find the one I&rsquo;ll be living at. The address had a strange &ldquo;º&rdquo; in it, but I didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to it. Well who cares, I&rsquo;m somewhere in the vicinity and I will figure out the rest when needed. As I will probably won&rsquo;t have cell phone coverage or internet, I asked my host to meet me at noon. A few hours till noon so it&rsquo;s a great time to explore the city (it&rsquo;s easy to do when you travel light).</p>

<p>The La Rambla main street is the main tourists street. I liked it for being great for people watching. Of course, because it&rsquo;s the main street people are not the only thing you see. You can also see some interesting activities going on, like cops running after a thief. And from what I read on the internet it gets even more interesting once the sun goes down. Following my tactics for walking (walk where your eyes look) I soon reach the sea. As someone who is always attracted by the water or by the sky, this is the great place to sit for a few minutes and relax.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24100057912/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="12"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1441/24100057912_606493f9f5_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="12"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As I was starting to get a feeling of the city, I made getting a local SIM card a priority. Having one could expand my opportunities. I had more success with this task than I had in the Netherlands, but not without glitches. First make sure you&rsquo;re getting the prepaid card, consultants are eager to sign you for a monthly contract. It&rsquo;s not so easy to understand that without asking, because even to get a prepaid SIM card you need to give your passport. Why do you need to make simple things so hard&hellip; After a while my card was set up and I could use it to call and connect to internet. Being used to my own country phone providers I missed that part that SMS is not included (only calls and data). I sent (or tried to as the host has not received them) a few messages to let my host know I will be at the place after I eat something.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that after eating I could not use my phone for calls (you just hear some words in Spanish before the call ends) or access the internet. I fixed that after a few days by putting some money in my account. This happened because I &ldquo;used&rdquo; my account before the plan was activated, so I was charged for those services, which made my balance negative which in turn freezes my account. <em>(facepalm) *deep breath out while holding fingers on the base of nose with eyes closed*</em>, &ldquo;fine, just fix it&rdquo; was my response to this BS.</p>

<p>Another funny thing is that in Barcelona you can find free WiFi everywhere. Unfortunately at all the places I could find you either have to download some app or you have to register with your personal details&hellip; And you will receive your login details to your email <em>(facepalm)</em>. Why do your have to make everything so complicated&hellip;</p>

<p>So, it&rsquo;s almost half an hour after the noon, I have no way of communicating. The great thing is that you start adapting fast when your ass is on fire (the good kind of stress). It didn&rsquo;t took me too long to figure out where the place I will be staying in is and meeting with my host.</p>

<p>The place I booked, well.. I start rising one eyebrow when I have to move through a narrow street which keeps you alert just in case someone decides to spill a piss pot out the window. The stairs to the room are great for snapping your neck off, good thing I&rsquo;m not drinking anymore, otherwise it could be dangerous. Also great that I travel light as someone traveling with a big suitcase would be spending at least half a day taking it up the stairs. The good thing about the room was that it had a private bathroom. Well actually it&rsquo;s the only good thing about the room. The vomit colored walls, Spanish melodramas from the rest of the house, knowing when someone used a bathroom, mosquitoes and a &ldquo;balcony&rdquo; which makes you think you&rsquo;re inside some third world country prison I didn&rsquo;t find that welcoming.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24100060382/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="6"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1470/24100060382_bda8c4b1d8_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="6"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Well, it could be much worse and I guess it&rsquo;s an opportunity to apply some stoic philosophy, so after some regrouping went out to explore the city. The sun is shining, weather is great (and I just arrived from negative temperatures) and it&rsquo;s a wonderful day. While walking around the city it&rsquo;s still enjoyable to see some palms and parrots in them. It doesn&rsquo;t take long for that to become unnoticeable, but for a while it&rsquo;s something special. I wasn&rsquo;t able to find that street again, but it was fun finding a big sculpture of the cat. All the walking from time to time makes you want to sit down for a few minutes to relax. Which is not very enjoyable as you&rsquo;re attacked by a bunch of flies right away.</p>

<p>The beach is lively at the day like this and it&rsquo;s wonderful to relax in the sun. Of course expect your relax time to be constantly interrupted by suggestions for massage or drinks. After a while you also start to ignore the beach vendors and just automatically reply with NO. You can find some sand artists along the beach or to be flashed by some naked human genitalia, nothing out of ordinary.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24181993166/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="45"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1548/24181993166_71454df5ff_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="45"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the evening expect to be harassed by food vendors. In Spain the tip isn&rsquo;t expected, but keep in mind that you will have to pay an extra fee if you eat in terrace/outside. I didn&rsquo;t find Spanish food to be that much to my liking. I enjoyed calamares and gambas (the small ones), but other than that I don&rsquo;t find the rest of the food that great. Also too much screwing around to get the food in your stomach. That I liked about eating in Spain is that most of the time you get some olives while waiting for your food. Could definitely do without the bread (and often it doesn&rsquo;t look that trustworthy). For drinks you can get a bucket of beer (cerveza) or sangria. Or for someone like me who stopped drinking your choice is a small bottle of water or cola.</p>

<p>After getting back to my room it felt more like being in a bar than in a private room. Loud music, applause, screams included free of charge. It didn&rsquo;t take too long to decide that I won&rsquo;t be able to work in this place for a week. I had to move. An hour later I had a new place booked, informed my host that I will be staying only till tomorrow and ready for more adventures.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Top 11 AWS IAM Best Practices]]></title>
    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/top-11-aws-iam-best-practices"/>
    <updated>2016-01-27T15:37:51+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://ifdattic.com/top-11-aws-iam-best-practices</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to control access to AWS services and resources. Following few best practices makes sure that your account is secure and easy to manage.</p>

<h2>1. Users &ndash; Create individual users</h2>

<p>Benefits of the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unique credentials</li>
<li>Individual credential rotation</li>
<li>Individual permissions</li>
</ul>


<h2>2. Groups &ndash; Manage permissions with groups</h2>

<p>Benefits of the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easier to assign the same permissions to multiple users</li>
<li>Simpler to re-assign permissions based on change in responsibilities</li>
<li>Only one change to update permissions for multiple users</li>
</ul>


<h2>3. Permissions &ndash; Grant least privilege</h2>

<p>Benefits of the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>More granular control</li>
<li>Less chance of people making mistakes</li>
<li>Easier to relax than to tighten up</li>
</ul>


<h2>4. Auditing &ndash; Enable AWS CloudTrail to get logs of API calls</h2>

<p>Benefits of the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visibility into your user activity by recording AWS API calls to an Amazon S3 bucket</li>
</ul>


<h2>5. Passwords &ndash; Configure a strong password policy</h2>

<p>Benefits of the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensures your users and your data are protected</li>
</ul>


<h2>6. MFA &ndash; Enable MFA for privileged users</h2>

<p>Benefits of the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Supplements username and password to require a one-time code during authentication</li>
</ul>


<h2>7. Roles &ndash; Use IAM roles for EC2 instances</h2>

<p>Benefits of the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy to manage access keys on EC2 instances</li>
<li>Automatic key rotation</li>
<li>Assign least privilege to the application</li>
<li>AWS SDKs fully integrated</li>
</ul>


<h2>8. Sharing &ndash; Use IAM roles to share access</h2>

<p>Benefits of the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>No need for security credentials</li>
<li>Easy to break sharing relationship</li>
<li>Use cases (cross-account access, intra-account delegation, federation)</li>
</ul>


<h2>9. Rotation &ndash; Rotate security credentials regularly</h2>

<p>Benefits of the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Normal best practice</li>
</ul>


<h2>10. Conditions &ndash; Restrict privileged access further with conditions</h2>

<p>Benefits of the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Additional granularity when defining permissions</li>
<li>Can be enabled for any AWS service API</li>
<li>Minimizes accidentally performing privileged actions</li>
</ul>


<h2>11. Root &ndash; Reduce/remove use of root</h2>

<p>Benefits of the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce potential for misuse of credentials</li>
</ul>


<p>You can get all of them as a check list at this <a href="https://trello.com/c/9cW2qarm/2-top-11-aws-iam-best-practices">public Trello card</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After purchasing the tickets to a SymfonyCon in Madrid I decided it would be great way to explore Spain. In Lithuania during that time weather gets colder so this will let me enjoy summer for a bit longer. My trip was supposed to be from October 23rd to December 9th. Maybe not the warmest months in Spain, but for someone who doesn&rsquo;t enjoy when it&rsquo;s very hot it looked like it will be a pleasantly warm trip.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24182297796/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="2014-spain-cover"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1675/24182297796_34b637327f_c.jpg" width="800" height="400" alt="2014-spain-cover"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Some might wonder why it was &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to be during that time range. The reason is simple with two great lessons for traveling: <strong>don&rsquo;t oversleep your flight</strong> and <strong>adapt</strong>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24100061032/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="3"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1581/24100061032_55b0332923_c.jpg" width="450" height="800" alt="3"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Actually, I wasn&rsquo;t surprised when this happened as the beginning of the trip wasn&rsquo;t going so well. Almost forgot my passport and almost got into head-on car crash. And I knew I will have to learn this lesson sooner or latter. For people who might be thinking &ldquo;<em>what an idiot, oversleeping a flight after setting up 10 different alarms</em>,&rdquo; I completely agree with you. Just not much to do when you set it for PM, not AM. But you can be damn sure I won&rsquo;t allow this to happen again anytime soon. Now I&rsquo;m too paranoid and have multiple systems in place.</p>

<p>You would also want to adapt quickly to situations and react with a cool head. I won&rsquo;t lie, I had thought about just dropping the whole thing and going back home where it&rsquo;s safe and relaxing. <em>You can&rsquo;t succeed without failing</em>. Half an hour later I had bought new tickets, canceled the reservations I won&rsquo;t be able to take, booked new places to stay at and ready to go for a chilly morning walk to freshen my head. It might have added an extra expense of $1000, but I always laugh remembering it, while the people who hear it are recovering from the shock.</p>

<p>After a long 3 hours flight and enjoying a wonderful sunrise I&rsquo;m in Barcelona ready to be overwhelmed by new experiences. It&rsquo;s an early morning. Streets are almost empty and it&rsquo;s something indescribable to see palms and enormous buildings for the first time. Unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t last for long as palms get filtered out just like ordinary street posts. Streets are dirty like everywhere else (cans, cigarette buts, etc.) and the buildings just give a feeling like they are trying to measure who has a bigger one (you know what).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/24208105595/in/album-72157663094134401/" title="5"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1479/24208105595_6d13a8cc23_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="5"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s not everyday you travel hundreds of miles to a completely different country, and I&rsquo;m grateful for that.</p>

    <id>http://ifdattic.com/how-to-create-a-tunnel-to-local-machine-with-ngrok</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When developing applications sometimes you need to access your current application using external sources. For example you want to test an application using a mobile device or how your application responds to a webhook. You could deploy your application on the publicly accessible server, but it will make development slow, having to deploy on each change.</p>

<p>The solution would be to create a tunnel to a local server on your machine. This way you could test your application on the mobile devices, show it to the clients, test webhooks. All of this can be achieved with <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a>.</p>

<p>You can jump to any of the sections:</p>

<li><a href="#configuring">Configuring ngrok</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusions">Conclusions</a></li>
</ul>


<p><a name="sample-application"></a></p>

<h2>Sample application</h2>

<p>You can create a tunnel for any web server.</p>

<p>For this article the simple Express.js application will be used. It has two routes for receiving <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests. You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/ifdattic/ngrok-article-code">GitHub</a></p>

<p>To launch the server execute the following command (<a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> is required):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><a name="installing"></a></p>

<h2>Installing ngrok</h2>

<p>ngrok is easy to install and works on all major platforms. <a href="https://ngrok.com/download">Download</a> the archive, unzip it, and run it. If you want to run it from any location move it to a directory which is in your <code>PATH</code> (e.g., <code>/usr/local/bin</code>).</p>

<p>Run <code>ngrok -h</code> to make sure it works and to get the documentation on how to use it.</p>

<p><a name="http-tunnel"></a></p>

<h2>Creating local HTTP tunnel</h2>

<p>To expose the web server simply provide the port number it is running on:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ngrok http 3000
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It will give you the URL to your tunnel and statistics.</p>

<p>If you will make a request to an URL you should get the response (replace the URL with one you got).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>curl http://7711dd0d.ngrok.io
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>curl http://7711dd0d.ngrok.io -d <span class="nv">name</span><span class="o">=</span>Andrew
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/23840463581/in/dateposted-public/" title="ngrok-http-tunnel"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5705/23840463581_2e6551dcb3_o.gif" width="1082" height="300" alt="ngrok-http-tunnel"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>ngrok provides the real-time web UI from which you can inspect the HTTP traffic for the tunnel. Open the URL provided by the created tunnel. From this web interface you can see all the information about requests and responses made.</p>

<p>One great feature which will be very handy when integrating webhooks is an ability to replay requests. This way you don&rsquo;t need to do anything to trigger the webhook; you could just replay the request after making changes.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/23840462921/in/dateposted-public/" title="ngrok-replay-request"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5797/23840462921_0ff96d97f3_o.gif" width="1160" height="580" alt="ngrok-replay-request"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you would like to add some basic protection to avoid anyone accessing your web server you can add an HTTP Basic Authentication:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ngrok http -auth<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;username:password&quot;</span> 3000
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Replace the <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> with credentials you want.</p>

<p>If you want to use advanced features of ngrok (like having custom subdomain or running from your domain) you will need an ngrok account and a paid plan.</p>

<p><a name="tcp-tunnel"></a></p>

<h2>Creating local TCP tunnel</h2>

<p>With ngrok you can expose SSH, database or some other service which runs over TCP. For example you could expose the MongoDB database running on your machine:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ngrok tcp 27017
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/23922941705/in/dateposted-public/" title="ngrok-tcp-tunnel"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1534/23922941705_f4d1692373_o.gif" width="1077" height="262" alt="ngrok-tcp-tunnel"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a name="configuring"></a></p>

<h2>Configuring ngrok</h2>

<p>ngrok can be configured using YAML configuration file. If no configuration file is provided the ngrok will try to load one from a default location (<code>$HOME/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml</code>).</p>

<p>By using <code>-config</code> option an explicit configuration file can be provided. It&rsquo;s possible to provide multiple configuration files and they are merged on top of each other. This way you can have global and project settings.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ngrok http -config ~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml -config project-config.yml 3000
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The most common use for configuration file is defining tunnels. Tunnels are defined under the <code>tunnels</code> property in the configuration file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To start the tunnel provide the name of the tunnel:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ngrok start -config ~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml -config project-config.yml app-protected
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To start all the defined tunnels use <code>--all</code> switch:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ngrok start -config ~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml -config project-config.yml --all
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a name="conclusions"></a></p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>This should be enough to take care of the most use cases you will need. ngrok probably won&rsquo;t be the tool you will be using everyday (depends on what you work on). For those days when you need to test a webhook or from another device you will be great for having ngrok in your toolbox.</p>

<p>Do you have a story of when a local tunnel helped / would have helped to solve your problem?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last day the weather was getting better and I thought about visiting a few other places I had on the list. Until I understood that I reached that point where I don&rsquo;t care anymore about the journey and just want to reach the destination. No point in getting over the head just to put another check mark on the list. Spent the rest of the day in the park, sitting &amp; relaxing until it was time to leave Amsterdam.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/23142641809" title="10495853_10202339209902188_6895619919232677953_o"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5756/23142641809_0d6602204c_c.jpg" width="800" height="400" alt="10495853_10202339209902188_6895619919232677953_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Unfortunately my journey got a little longer than I wanted. I think right after I bought the train ticket (I would have been told before buying if there were issues), something happened to the power lines (from what I was able to find out later) and the line between Amsterdam-Eindhoven was closed. At that time I didn&rsquo;t had a lot of experience riding trains and every information was in Dutch. Was walking around trying to figure out which train I should take and starting to get a feeling something is wrong. Got into one train, but my gut started to tell I should get out. After some time asked an employee which train is to Eindhoven and she told I have to get on that train (by pointing), go to Rotterdam and then go to Eindhoven.</p>

<p>Something was definitely wrong. I got in a full train and started browsing internet to see how my plans are changing. It looked like my 1.5 hours Amsterdam-Eindhoven trip in best case will be 1.5 hours Amsterdam-Rotterdam, wait for 30-60 minutes, 1.5 hours Rotterdam-Eindhoven. Crap. Oh well, not like I can change anything. Sit down and try to relax, you still have a long trip left.</p>

<p>A much longer trip than I expected. Towards the end I started to notice that the train might not go to main train station. Maybe I was wrong, but it looked like at one point it will start going in opposite direction and the last time I waited I ended up in an airport not a city center. It was time to make a decision and I chose to get out and walk the rest of the way (if I was right it would be a shorter walk than going all the way).</p>

<p>I was in a middle of nowhere and had about 30 minutes to walk 10 kilometers. If I was late I will need to wait about an hour for the next train which would also take longer than 1.5 hours to reach the Eindhoven. This trip got long enough so no thank you. At this point I was very happy about traveling alone and only with a backpack. Started looking at the map and taking long fast strides to get a chance to reach a train station on time. Looking for fastest way led me through roads, fields, shady neighborhoods, etc. Didn&rsquo;t care. Just kept on walking from time to time letting out a curse word and motivating myself with &ldquo;if you gonna be late I will punch you in the face, hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After I got the train station in my view it felt great and I was still on time. Of course waiting in the line to buy the ticket, seeing how slowly it was moving and how fast the watch arrow turned was nerving. Was able to buy the tickets, go to the WC and wait on platform one minute before the train arrived. Sat down, relaxed. All that was left was a 1.5 hours train ride and my journey is done.</p>

<p>Or so I thought. Contacted my airbnb host that I will arrive in a few hours and come to him after I got a glass of cold beer somewhere to relax my nerves. My host suggested that I won&rsquo;t take too long as a big storm (supposedly) will start at around 11PM. I thanked him for the warning, the day was already long without any extra surprises.</p>

<p>After leaving the train I bought a can of beer at the train station shop. The day was long enough without having to go to some noisy bar. 8 minutes of walk to the place of my stay for the night and this long day would be done. I left the train station, walking towards the traffic lights and after a few meters the rain starts drizzling. Nothing what would be bad for 8 minutes, but just in case I put on my jacket. After few more meters the rain starts pouring in buckets. Fuck! Spent the next 8 minutes sprinting and looking for non existent places to hide from the rain.</p>

<p>The host opens the doors and I&rsquo;m standing dripping water only with my underwear dry (so not the worst walk in the rain I had). He shows me around the place and at first I go to the shower. After which I&rsquo;m starting to feel like a human again. Open a can of beer and work for half an hour; just needed something to do where I would be in control.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/16898784814/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10483184_10202339208222146_4097043738260715951_o"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8694/16898784814_3cddbf26de_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="10483184_10202339208222146_4097043738260715951_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My room was in a 11th floor and in something that I would call a glass balcony. With a thunderstorm going outside at least I slept very well (rain, thunder, turbulence relaxes me &amp; helps me sleep). The next morning I took the bus to airport. Of course the ticket machine takes no paper money &amp; who the hell has coins (they are heavy). After going through all the bus and exchanging 5 euros in paper to about 3 euros in coins (didn&rsquo;t care anymore, just needed the ticket) I reached an airport.</p>

<p>While boarding the plane the hostess suggested that maybe I would like to take the exit row seat. My first thought &ndash; oh great, gonna get lost one more time, well at least I will have enough room for my legs until we crash. I sit down, turn on vocals chill-out music &amp; try to relax. Towards the landing the turbulence starts to pick up helping me to relax and add panic for others. When the following lyrics come up &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m falling down, I&rsquo;m falling fast.</em>&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not making this up, this would be too stupid to make up. I take report of my surroundings &ndash; had a fresh drink of water, nice music is playing in my head, sitting comfortably &ndash; screw it, we can crash, I&rsquo;m feeling happy now. Still couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from starting to chuckle from this situation. Which I find from side view might have looked a little disturbing. Well, we landed safely and this was the end of the trip.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would like to live in Amsterdam/Netherlands. If I started to drink &amp; smoke it might have extra points about living there, but still wouldn&rsquo;t sell me so easy on long term living. But after some time I noticed that I do like Amsterdam. It&rsquo;s a wonderful place &amp; walking around it for a week or few makes me happy.</p>

    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/continuous-integration-nodejs-project-using-shippable"/>
    <updated>2015-12-08T11:02:05+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://ifdattic.com/continuous-integration-of-node-dot-js-project-using-shippable</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago I wrote an article <a href="http://ifdattic.com/continuous-integration-php-project-using-shippable">how to use Shippable as continuous integration service for PHP project</a>. This is similar article except that it is for a Node.js project.</p>

<p>One of the biggest benefits of Shippable is that you are able to test private repository before needing to pay for it (good for hobby projects which you don&rsquo;t know there they might lead).</p>

<p>You can jump to any of the sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></li>
<li><a href="#initial-config">Initial configuration</a></li>
<li><a href="#environment-variables-mongodb">Environment variables &amp; MongoDB</a></li>
<li><a href="#testing">Testing</a></li>
<li><a href="#update-nodejs-version">Update Node.js version</a></li>
<li><a href="#enable-project">Enable project in Shippable</a></li>
<li><a href="#code-coverage">Code coverage</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a></h2>

<p>To start using this service you just need to sign up using your GitHub or BitBucket account. If you want to test private repositories you will have to give Shippable permission to them (by default it only sees public repositories). The code used in this article is available at <a href="https://github.com/ifdattic/javascript-shippable-ci-article-code">GitHub</a>. It&rsquo;s an Express.js project, but with small changes any Node.js project could be tested.</p>

<h2>Initial configuration <a name="initial-config"></a></h2>

<p>Your project needs to have a <code>shippable.yml</code> configuration file. In it you define scripts which will be run, environment variables, language, versions to test, etc.</p>

<p>First let&rsquo;s configure Shippable to test a Node.js project and do it for <code>5.1.1</code> version. Add the following to your <code>shippable.yml</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">language</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">node_js</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">node_js</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">5.1.1</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To have our project working we need to install modules using <code>npm</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">before_script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">npm install</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Environment variables &amp; MongoDB <a name="environment-variables-mongodb"></a></h2>

<p>The application uses MongoDB for persistence. It&rsquo;s very easy to include services with Shippable.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t want to hard code configuration variables for your application. To fix that we will use the environment variables to configure the application depending on the environment it is in. You can set the global environment variables which are the same between builds and you can set simple environment variables which are different between builds (extending your testing matrix). If you have environment variables which you don&rsquo;t want to show (like passwords) you can add it as a secure environment variable.</p>

<p>To get the secure environment variable you need to go to project settings. It has a panel &ldquo;Encrypt.&rdquo; You provide the environment variables in the box and after clicking &ldquo;Encrypt&rdquo; you get the snippet of code you can paste in your <code>shippable.yml</code> file.</p>

    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/natura-artis-magistra-zoo"/>

    <id>http://ifdattic.com/natura-artis-magistra-zoo-part-7-testing-the-world-and-looking-for-home-series</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to visit the Hortus Botanicus and Natura Artis Magistra before leaving. Unfortunately the last few days of my stay was rainy and walking around in the rain didn&rsquo;t feel like an exciting way to spend time. The rain let down a little bit giving me chance to visit the zoo. At first I was thinking about skipping it. I seen animals in the cage before so it won&rsquo;t be anything interesting. This is what I thought, but I&rsquo;m glad I just did it anyway. The ticket isn&rsquo;t cheap, but for the value you get it&rsquo;s worth it. After buying the ticket was asked if I would like to buy the map and the money spent for it will be used to improve the elephant section. I try to avoid extras like guided tours, audio tours, etc., but elephants never did anything bad to me so why not, let&rsquo;s help the little guys/gals. The map doesn&rsquo;t hurt as the place is enormous.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed is that animals are actually not in the cages. So you better behave as there is not a lot of protection between getting your ass kicked. Seeing camels walking around with a bunch of other animals and being separated only by a narrow line of water looks awesome, disturbing, relaxing. All at the same time. Walking by them is like walking through a bad neighborhood, you try to look like you belong there and are ready to run just in case. Walking past the birds gives a different reaction. It&rsquo;s all in my head, but I just wanted to run to them, start making motions from ground to air with my hands and shouting &ldquo;<em>Fly you fools!! Freedom, fly to freedom!!</em>&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure if they could talk, their reaction to this would be &ldquo;<em>Go eF yourself!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>After calming myself down started to wander around the zoo, looking at animals, reading about them and just having good time. Too bad the tigers (I think) habitat was closed for renovations. Walked past the cages with parrots. I do dislike them. They are just too noisy for my taste. Around that time the rain started to pick up again. Fortunately I just reached the aquarium part of the zoo giving me shelter from it.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17519025602/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10550111_10202330518924919_6303576271895424654_o"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8754/17519025602_ac7e0f45d7_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="10550111_10202330518924919_6303576271895424654_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The aquarium is nice with lots of colors. Got into an eye staring contest with a blue frog (wanted to find out if she&rsquo;s real or not). Until noticed that I got surrounded by a bunch of her friends and it was time for me to leave. You can see a bunch of strange fishes, some of which makes you think about against getting a diver&rsquo;s license. Just too many things which got away from the horror movie and would eat you.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17495048186/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10428183_10202330521404981_5355992987067705238_o"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7775/17495048186_36c9b0ab05_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="10428183_10202330521404981_5355992987067705238_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After wandering around the zoo for a little longer found the terrarium with spiders &amp; snakes &amp; other cute lovely pets. It would be great to visit them during the feeding time. Or if they would let you pet them (I&rsquo;m against that as it would be too much stress for the poor animal, but I just always like touching &amp; biting new/interesting things).</p>

<p>You start understanding they don&rsquo;t care too much about cages when you reach one of the &ldquo;inclusive areas&rdquo; you can travel through. The first one for me was the butterflies habitat. It&rsquo;s something like a small patch of a tropical forest you can walk around with butterflies flying all around you. In some places where there food for them and you could take a closer look. So far I can&rsquo;t compare it, but it was the first time experience on how the tropical forest might feel &amp; I liked to get that under my belt. Thanks to my imagination I was also expecting a velociraptor to run past me, but I guess you can&rsquo;t get everything you want. *Side note: After a year I visited Hortus Botanicus which allows you to experience different climate zones, still no velociraptors :(*</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17519020132/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10551528_10202330524125049_746054191702381928_o"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5460/17519020132_a1ea28907a_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="10551528_10202330524125049_746054191702381928_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Another open area where you can get closer to animals was the lemur patch. You can walk right past them and maybe get a massage if you sit down (maybe if you forgot to see the bite signs). They look cute enough, but I didn&rsquo;t trust them enough for that. Was nice to learn that they have hands similar to human hands, with fingers and everything. You live and learn. They can scream loud too.</p>

<p>Walking around found the wolf&rsquo;s habitat. Don&rsquo;t know why, but I adore them. Maybe because I met a wolf while walking alone in the forest when I was about 5-7 years old. Maybe for some other reason. I do find them beautiful &amp; royal animals. Too bad due to rain or other reasons it was hard to have a closer look at them.</p>

<p>After a while I reached a tropical house (I think it&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s called). The signs about not letting out the animals and getting bitten didn&rsquo;t made me comfortable. If it wasn&rsquo;t safe they won&rsquo;t be allowing you to enter and with this thought I entered the house. I slowly started going in deeper, looking around to make sure no one attacks me by surprise and still not sure if I&rsquo;m allowed in here.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17521337305/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10497313_10202330523645037_7410082079628888463_o"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8835/17521337305_6df8a106c6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="10497313_10202330523645037_7410082079628888463_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There is two categories of animals I &ldquo;fear&rdquo; &ndash; rodents (rats, mice, etc.) &amp; amphibians (frogs, etc.). I&rsquo;m not sure why. I just don&rsquo;t like them. Even in the toy shop I will walk around them. I include (included actually from then) bats to the same category thinking of them as flying rats. When I was about in the middle of the house from the other part of it the bat started flying into me, flew past me, turned around and flew past me again. At that moment I was crouching on the floor with my hands on my head, not sure what I should do.</p>

<p>The zoo employees who were sitting and talking told me it&rsquo;s safe and I don&rsquo;t need to be afraid of them. Easy for you to say, I don&rsquo;t see monsters flying past your head (all in my head, enchanted by wicked imagination). We started talking and she took me to the tree where the bat was eating. Once you get close enough to punch them in the face they are actually cute monsters.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17333556728/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10494995_10202330525205076_2228704594717199738_o"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5442/17333556728_e295b0927f_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="10494995_10202330525205076_2228704594717199738_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>She helped me to find all the animals what are in the house and their stories. The big lizards and the small lizards. The monkeys, how one of them has a broken tail and another one just had a baby. That squirrel animal from Ice Age movie. We also talked about the zoo itself. Was nice to chat with her and at the end I was comfortable staying in that house. Still being alert to do a karate chop in case someone attacked. I know, I&rsquo;m paranoid.</p>

<p>I put my nose inside the birds house (which was adjacent). I&rsquo;m not a big fan of birds (they are too noisy for me) &amp; I didn&rsquo;t want to get bombarded by crap so turned around and left.</p>

<p>The zoo was close to closing time so I chose to go past the water birds habitat which ends near exit. For someone who can&rsquo;t (probably) swim and being surrounded by birds which looks like drug dealers it wasn&rsquo;t very comfortable walking through a narrow metal bridge (without anything to hang on). But it&rsquo;s a new experience.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17519040952/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10541062_10202330522805016_403624763809583833_o"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5468/17519040952_daa1a41dea_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="10541062_10202330522805016_403624763809583833_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t listen to the voice in my head (something I should do more often) and went to the zoo. It was a surprise and a new experience to walk so close to animals not in cages. If you get a chance I would suggest to check it out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you use Mac OSX and do a lot of work in terminal the <a href="https://www.iterm2.com">iTerm</a> application will become your friend fast. It&rsquo;s a great terminal application and it would be hard to imagine my days without it.</p>

<p>Once you learn a few shortcut keys and develop your personal work flow you would hardly want to leave that black (differs) window.</p>

<p>Below is some of the shortcut keys I use.</p>

<h2>Working with multiple terminals</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s rare occasion having only one terminal open as often I&rsquo;m working with multiple projects / tools at the same time. Sometimes even if I&rsquo;m not using something at the moment (or in the last few days / weeks) the terminal windows are left as is (often to avoid going to the needed directory). And sometimes you just need to try something fast and close it. Following shortcuts allow me to open new terminals, move between them, close once I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>

<blockquote><p>New Tab <code>⌘T</code></p>

<p>Previous Tab <code>⌘←</code></p>

<p>Next Tab <code>⌘→</code></p>

<p>Close tab <code>⌘w</code></p></blockquote>

<p>You could move the tabs around using the following shortcut keys, but I rarely use them.</p>

<blockquote><p>Move Tab Right <code>⇧⌘→</code></p>

<p>Move Tab Left <code>⇧⌘←</code></p></blockquote>

<h2>Working with multiple terminals in same tab</h2>

<p>Opening a new tab takes care of the most use cases, but sometimes there&rsquo;s a need to see multiple terminals at the same time. The splitting the tab shortcut keys are the lifesaver in those moments. You can go crazy with splitting the current tab (if you need to)!</p>

<blockquote><p>Split Vertically with Current Profile <code>⌘D</code></p>

<p>Split Horizontally with Current Profile <code>⇧⌘D</code></p></blockquote>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/22596362330/in/dateposted-public/" title="iterm-split-windows-go-crazy"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5658/22596362330_9a8d2fabed_c.jpg" width="733" height="800" alt="iterm-split-windows-go-crazy"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Your performance would suffer a lot if you had to use the mouse to use any of those terminals. For that problem the shortcut keys to move between the panes solve it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Next Pane <code>⌘]</code></p>

<p>Previous Pane <code>⌘[</code></p></blockquote>

<p>You can also move between panes directionally. Most of the time I can&rsquo;t remember the shortcut keys for it, previous/next pane works great, rarely have more than 2 panes at the time.</p>

<blockquote><p>Select Pane Above <code>⌥⌘↑</code></p>

<p>Select Pane Below <code>⌥⌘↓</code></p>

<p>Select Pane Left <code>⌥⌘←</code></p>

<p>Select Pane Right <code>⌥⌘→</code></p></blockquote>

<h2>Interacting with the terminal</h2>

<p>The following shortcut keys are not used that often (sometimes due to failing personal memory). They do come in handy from time to time when you need to do something with the output which is in terminal.</p>

<blockquote><p>Clear Buffer <code>⌘K</code></p>

<p>Scroll Up <code>⇧Page Up</code></p>

<p>Scroll Down <code>⇧Page Down</code></p>

<p>Find&hellip; <code>⌘F</code></p></blockquote>

<h2>Changing font size</h2>

<p>The iTerm on my machine is configured to my liking and works for almost all the use cases. For that reason it&rsquo;s rare to change the font size. If you&rsquo;re making a presentation, recording screen cast or your eyes are tired shortcut keys for changing font size solves that problem.</p>

<blockquote><p>Make Text Bigger <code>⌘+</code></p>

<p>Make Text Normal Size <code>⌘0</code></p>

<p>Make Text Smaller <code>⌘-</code></p></blockquote>

<h2>Custom shortcuts keys</h2>

<p>You can change global shortcut keys from profile preferences <code>Keys</code> tab. One shortcut key I find useful is deleting the last word. It uses the <code>⌘←Delete</code> as keyboard shortcut and sends the <code>0x1B 0x08</code> hex code (action).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/22841825873/in/dateposted-public/" title="iterm-custom-shortcut-key"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/597/22841825873_9521a2502d_c.jpg" width="800" height="464" alt="iterm-custom-shortcut-key"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<blockquote><p>Go Left One Word <code>⌥←</code> (send escape sequence <code>b</code>)</p>

<p>Go Right One Word <code>⌥→</code> (send escape sequence <code>f</code>)</p></blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>These are the shortcut keys I use daily with iTerm. Learning shortcut keys for any application can move you to a power user level and improve your productivity a lot. The problem is remembering all of them.</p>

    <link href="http://ifdattic.com/continuous-integration-php-project-using-shippable"/>
    <updated>2015-08-24T14:14:23+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://ifdattic.com/continuous-integration-of-php-project-using-shippable</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I started using <a href="https://app.shippable.com/">Shippable</a> as my continuous integration service. It adds a lot to peace of mind knowing that your tests are always run (even if you forget to do it on your local environment) and you have another point of failure for your application.</p>

<p>The biggest reason I chose Shippable is that it has a sane pricing. You get one concurrent build for free and this includes the private repositories. This works great for side projects which you don&rsquo;t want to make public, but want to use good tools without a lot of hassle. If the project picks up and you need more hamster power it&rsquo;s easy to ramp it up without having to sell a kidney or two. For those wanting to say that &ldquo;We need to charge that much to provide good service&rdquo; I understand that and I personally look with one eyebrow raised at software which is just free (business needs to make money to survive). Just that for simple side projects (hobby) that will probably won&rsquo;t bring even a dollar spending hundreds a month is not a best financial decision.</p>

<p>You can jump to any of the sections:</p>

<li><a href="#environment-variables-mysql">Environment variables &amp; MySQL</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a></h2>

<p>To start using this service you just need to sign up using your GitHub or BitBucket account. If you want to test private repositories you will have to give Shippable permission to them (by default it only sees public repositories). The code used in this article is available at <a href="https://github.com/ifdattic/symfony-shippable-ci-article-code">GitHub</a>. It&rsquo;s a Symfony project, but with small changes any PHP project could be tested.</p>

<h2>Initial configuration <a name="initial-config"></a></h2>

<p>Your project needs to have a <code>shippable.yml</code> configuration file. In it you define scripts which will be run, environment variables, language, versions to test, etc.</p>

<p>First let&rsquo;s configure Shippable to test a PHP project and do it for <code>5.5</code> &amp; <code>5.6</code> versions. Add the following to your <code>shippable.yml</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">language</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">php</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">php</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">5.5</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">5.6</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Just in case it might be helpful to have the application log files (in case the build is failing and you&rsquo;re not sure why). You can tell shippable to save the artifacts from a build and make it available for download using the <code>archive</code> option. The <code>shippable</code> directory is a special one were all the files from build is being kept (like test coverage reports, etc.). Add the following to your <code>shippable.yml</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">archive</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">true</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">after_script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">cp -r ./app/logs shippable/logs</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will create an archive for download after the build is done. The <code>after_script</code> is commands which are run after the build and they will not affect the status of the build.</p>

<p>To have our project working we need to install libraries using composer. First we update composer to have the latest version and then install all the required libraries:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">before_script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">composer self-update -n</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">composer install --prefer-dist -n</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>PHPUnit testing <a name="phpunit-testing"></a></h2>

<p>The <code>AppBundle</code> which comes with new Symfony project has a simple PHPUnit test. Add the following to run the PHPUnit tests:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">phpunit -c app --log-junit shippable/testresults/junit.xml --coverage-xml shippable/codecoverage</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="https://github.com/ifdattic/symfony-shippable-ci-article-code/commit/b07abaccb788284c17901796e1849ca24fd57972">Commit the changes</a> and push it to GitHub. Now that we have the basic set-up for Shippable it&rsquo;s time to add it to a service.</p>

<h2>Enable project in Shippable <a name="enable-project"></a></h2>

<p>First choose the subscription to use and when in projects section click the big plus icon which says &ldquo;Enable Project.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/20815778916/in/album-72157650815525029/" title="shippable-choose-subscription"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5824/20815778916_6d4e51a029.jpg" width="421" height="212" alt="shippable-choose-subscription"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Force a synchronization if the repository you want is not in the list. Click on key icon to enable the project.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/20219448984/in/album-72157650815525029/" title="shippable-enable-project"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/577/20219448984_b17b72e6a4_c.jpg" width="800" height="738" alt="shippable-enable-project"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After it is done you can manually start a build or it will happen automatically the next time you will push a commit.</p>

<p>After a while a build should finish and you should get the similar view.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/20832499472/in/album-72157650815525029/" title="shippable-phpunit"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/696/20832499472_42578b27d8_c.jpg" width="800" height="654" alt="shippable-phpunit"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>By clicking &ldquo;Download Artifacts&rdquo; you can download the logs &amp; other files which were generated during the build.</p>

<h2>phpspec testing <a name="phpspec-testing"></a></h2>

<p>Lets expand our testing suite with <a href="http://www.phpspec.net">phpspec</a>. You can see that code was added in this <a href="https://github.com/ifdattic/symfony-shippable-ci-article-code/pull/1">pull request</a>.</p>

<p>To run phpspec tests just add a command to <code>script</code> in your <code>shippable.yml</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">./bin/phpspec run -fpretty --verbose -n</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You should be able to see similar view if everything was correct.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/20815778566/in/album-72157650815525029/" title="shippable-phpspec"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5699/20815778566_b826863744_c.jpg" width="800" height="632" alt="shippable-phpspec"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2>Behat testing <a name="behat-testing"></a></h2>

<p>Lets expand our testing suite with <a href="http://behat.org/">Behat</a>. You can see that code was added in this <a href="https://github.com/ifdattic/symfony-shippable-ci-article-code/pull/2">pull request</a>. Please note that currently there is no tagged version of Behat (at the time of writing latest is <code>3.0.15</code>) which has <code>junit</code> formatter, for that reason a <code>dev</code> version is installed.</p>

<p>To run Behat tests we will start the built-in web server &amp; then run the tests. This can be done by adding following commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">./app/console server:start -n</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">./bin/behat --format=progress --out=std --format=junit --out=shippable/testresults -n</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After the tests are finished, stop the built-in web server:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">after_script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">./app/console server:stop -n</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The default XDebug nesting level is set at 100 which is very small and throws a fatal PHP error. This can be fixed by setting it at higher level in <code>php.ini</code> file. Add the following to your <code>shippable.yml</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">before_install</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">echo &quot;xdebug.max_nesting_level = 1000&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.phpenv/versions/$(phpenv version-name)/etc/php.ini</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You should be able to see similar view if everything was correct.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/20832501252/in/album-72157650815525029/" title="shippable-behat"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/603/20832501252_9f8620943e_c.jpg" width="800" height="636" alt="shippable-behat"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2>Environment variables &amp; MySQL <a name="environment-variables-mysql"></a></h2>

<p>You will probably be using a MySQL or something similar for the persistence in your application. It&rsquo;s very easy to include services with Shippable.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t want to hard code configuration variables for your application. To fix that we will use the environment variables to configure the application depending on the environment it is in. You can set the global environment variables which are the same between builds and you can set simple environment variables which are different between builds (extending your testing matrix). If you have environment variables which you don&rsquo;t want to show (like passwords) you can add it as a secure environment variable.</p>

<p>You can see the code which was added in this <a href="https://github.com/ifdattic/symfony-shippable-ci-article-code/pull/3">pull request</a>.</p>

<p>To get the secure environment variable you need to go to project settings. It has a panel &ldquo;Encrypt Env Vars.&rdquo; You provide the environment variables in the box and after clicking &ldquo;Encrypt&rdquo; you get the snippet of code you can paste in your <code>shippable.yml</code> file.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/20849195481/in/album-72157650815525029/" title="shippable-secure-environment-variable"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/757/20849195481_146797af4e_c.jpg" width="800" height="513" alt="shippable-secure-environment-variable"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Environment variables which start with <code>SYMFONY__</code> are converted to normal variables after composer finishes the install. The double underscore becomes a dot. The environment variable <code>SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_NAME</code> becomes <code>env.database_name</code> parameter in your application. Lets add the database configuration and a secret value:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The MySQL database can be created by adding the command in <code>before_script</code> option:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">before_script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">mysql -e &quot;CREATE DATABASE $SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_NAME&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">./app/console doctrine:schema:create -n</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will create the database as it&rsquo;s defined in the environment variable. After the database is created it will run the queries to create a schema for your application.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re using built-in server for testing our application. However it has no access to environment variables. To fix that extend your <code>php.ini</code> configuration to include them (you probably won&rsquo;t need this if you&rsquo;re using Apache or different web server):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Amsterdam also has an Ice Bar. The ticket includes a drink in the normal bar. When time for another group comes you see an instructional video, put on some special clothes and enter I would say a medium sized freezer. It contains a bar made from ice and a few ice sculptures, nothing fancy. You can get two drinks which is either beer or vodka with juice (or without). As you can get only one glass the host suggests to choose your first drink wisely as you might end drinking beer from a shot glass. Glasses are also made from ice. You have big gloves, but make sure you&rsquo;re holding it tightly as a lot of them end up on the ground. Even thought the jacket keeps you warm enough I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest shoes with thin soles, your feet will get freezing fast. Or at least don&rsquo;t stop moving. I found this a pleasant experience and if you drink it&rsquo;s worth a visit. Barcelona also has the Ice bar by the beach and would have visited it again except I wasn&rsquo;t drinking anymore at that time.</p>

<p>As for the Heineken factory museum I would suggest to skip it. Unless you&rsquo;re some college student which finds things like this interesting. I had my doubts about visiting it, but while walking past it decided what why not, maybe it will have something fun. What a waste of money &amp; time. The big part of it is commercials related material or some crappy touristy things. It has some learning elements about how the beer is made, but they are not that interesting to catch your attention. At one point there is some kind of a ride which might be fun except what you would need to wait at least 20 minutes for it so you just skip it. At the end you can choose if you want to get two glasses of beer or one which you can pour yourself (which also has an enormous line). I disliked this one and recommending to skip it. Rather go spend that money to visit <a href="http://ifdattic.com/amsterdam-dungeon">Amsterdam Dungeon</a> for the second time.</p>

<p>You can also find Torture Museum in Amsterdam. It isn&rsquo;t expensive so if you have nothing better to do you might want to visit it. Most of the time you&rsquo;re just walking through badly lid corridors checking out some torturing instruments and reading info about them. Other than a few strange/painful torture devices there isn&rsquo;t much to do in this one.</p>

<p>I also visited a Jews Museum, more or less because I was walking past it. It&rsquo;s a nice museum. I&rsquo;m just not emotionally invested in what it has to offer for it to be of much interest. If you&rsquo;re a Jew or connected to this topic I&rsquo;m sure you would find it interesting. Choose yourself.</p>

<p>Farther away from the city center you can find the Tropenmuseum. Take the lift to the top floor and start exploring it. I would say it&rsquo;s an interesting museum and allows you to get some basic knowledge about cultures from around the world. From amazon tribes to American sixties. It allows you to get a feeling how it might felt to be in some pop cafe or inside a hut. It was a relaxing place to visit and my suggestion would be to check it out.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/18898883370/in/album-72157654947589872/" title="IMG_20150623_124804"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/491/18898883370_935ed9bae5_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_20150623_124804"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Near the NEMO science center is the maritime museum which isn&rsquo;t that easy to miss due to a big ship outside it. As in most places you will be asked to put your bag in the locker which in here is a bit trickier than in most places were you give it to someone or get a key for locker. This one is higher tech, but as long as you follow the instructions you should be fine. The building has many wings which has different expositions. Can&rsquo;t remember them all, but some of things which you will see is history of slavery and lot of ship models. I found that just wondering around felt relaxing as this place had a nice &ldquo;aura.&rdquo; The ship is a little modified replica of some real ship. Below deck you will find storage space and living quarters. Don&rsquo;t forget to jump into one of hammocks and let your legs rest for a minute. I could also say that the ship wasn&rsquo;t made for tall people so watch your head! Above deck you find living quarters of a captain, the kitchen, steering wheel (you can tell I&rsquo;m not an expert on ships). All in all I wouldn&rsquo;t say that museum has something out of ordinary to show, but I found it relaxing and suggest to visit it. Also if you would look at the ceiling you might see the cousin of WALL-E cleaning the windows.</p>

<p>Of course you can&rsquo;t talk about Amsterdam without mentioning Red Light District. Skip the rest of the article if this topic is not acceptable to you.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so integrated into the city center that you will probably pass it even by accident. You should watch out were you&rsquo;re walking as sometimes you might get blinded by a nice pair and have an accident. If you came to Amsterdam for bodily pleasure there are enough choices to find something you like. I personally look at all this RLD like an equivalent of fast food restaurant: get in, get out, vomit around the corner. No, I&rsquo;m not against prostitution and just like prostitutes my stance is what it should be legal everywhere. I just look at sex in a different perspective and RLD approach is not for me. If you didn&rsquo;t come to visit red or blue lights, you will soon start filtering out all the knocks and invitations.</p>

<p>If you walk around the church you might notice a pair of breasts on the ground. On internet it&rsquo;s made much more exciting, in reality it&rsquo;s &ndash; meh. From the smell you might also notice that RLD has a lot of coffee shops. I always liked the look and smell of cannabis plant, but now the smell makes me nauseous and had to do some navigation to avoid it. RLD is beautiful and has a different feel after sun down. Of course you hear a lot more of &ldquo;pssst, cocaine?&rdquo; Just keep on walking.</p>

<p>I would suggest to visit the prostitution museum. Especially if you think it&rsquo;s a joke and if you&rsquo;re paying for these services you can be an ass and do whatever you want. If you&rsquo;re on the next side of scales where you think prostitution is an abomination, should be banned and punished you should also visit and maybe learn a thing or two. Wondering what is my view on this topic? In my opinion every one of us is a prostitute, the only difference is only which part of yourself you&rsquo;re selling. Just try to be a decent human being and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>You will find Hash &amp; Hemp museum in RLD. It doesn&rsquo;t have anything very exciting, but it&rsquo;s a nice museum to visit. For a few euros you get a chance to see some artifacts from the old days. If you have time to spend I think it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/16898968414/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="616541_10202287386206628_588367605791041677_o"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7776/16898968414_c727a355a4_z.jpg" width="607" height="640" alt="616541_10202287386206628_588367605791041677_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>RLD has a few establishments providing live shows. The best choice would be Casa Rosso Theater or it&rsquo;s the one I visited. It&rsquo;s not cheap at about €50 with two drinks, but in my opinion worth the experience. You enter something that looks like a small cinema/theater with seats split into two sections. Right section is for groups (from that I understood) containing noisy teenagers who already had a little too much to drink. The left side contains walk-ins ranging from normal looking people to some shady looking people in raincoats. Once in a while the waiters walk in bringing the drinks and taking the orders for drinks. I guess the place has to look the part and if I had to describe how the waiters looked like I would say take someone from 60&rsquo;s or 80&rsquo;s porn movies (I still have no idea how it should look, but it&rsquo;s the thought which comes to mind). The shows have a mix of a girl playing with herself, a pair having fun, strip with someone from the audience, games with audience participation. If you want to take part in the show avoid being a walk-in. Learned that I was right about Rammstein music being good for &ldquo;making love.&rdquo; Also that I should start exercising. A nice experience to put under your belt if you have €50 to spend and want a few giggles.</p>

    <id>http://ifdattic.com/amsterdam-amsterdam-dungeon-part-5-testing-the-world-and-looking-for-home-series</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The most enjoyable place I visited was the Amsterdam Dungeon, oh it was amazing. My suggestion would be just to find when the next play is and come a bit before that time. Even though it&rsquo;s funny to listen to the ghost in the cage, he starts repeating after a while and it&rsquo;s too loud to have a normal conversation with other prisoners. I would try to not disclose too much information about it (spoilers). I will have to write about some fun moments I had in there. This also contains some gruesome parts so you might want to skip it if it&rsquo;s not your thing. Warning provided, let the fun begin.</p>

<p>At first the group was split and I was expecting some cheap thrills, like a skeleton dropping out of the ceiling or something like that. After an elevator ride down you&rsquo;re some place looking like a torture dungeon. Some animatronics, spiked chair and stuff like that. Well if this is it then it will be boring, very boring. After a few minutes the sound of dragging chain begins and the door opens. I would say the actors are professional and react well to all the small problems. I feel a little bad about them because hearing them &ldquo;talk loudly / scream&rdquo; my own throat starts hurting; well they are probably used to it.</p>

<p>I take the front row seat. One from the group is chosen to be tortured and after some acting the lights go out. The voice starts praying in random places. Some screams from the group in random places and then something happened which made me thing &ldquo;OK, this might be fun after all.&rdquo; To better know why I liked this attraction is what I feel refreshed by &ldquo;seeing fear in other people eyes.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t imagine me as some kind of monster who runs down the street with a chainsaw after the sun goes down; just for some reason it makes me smile and refreshed. OK, I&rsquo;m not explaining this well, fine, just imagine me running down the street with a chainsaw, brrrm brrrrm brrrrrrrrrrrrrrmmmmmm. It&rsquo;s all fun and games until someone loses the hand :D</p>

<p>After this one we went to a tavern, learning some history, getting few simple scares, etc. The tavern wench warned about not trusting anyone as sailors end up in ships because they wrote their name selling their soul. Then one from the group was asked to come and write his name. Which he did (oh come on, weren&rsquo;t you listening about not trusting anyone and not writing your name). Then she displays that he was tricked and now he will be going to work in the ship. But here&rsquo;s your chance to save your soul and if you open not a skull picture from three choices you will be free. Otherwise everyone will be going to the ship. Oh come on, this one is easy, you choose one, tell to open the other two and win, but no.. She mixes the choices, he chooses one of them, it&rsquo;s the skull and everyone is going to a ship.</p>

<p>The next room is below the ship deck and the pirate is explaining her life story, what a tasty soup rats make and choosing the jobs for everyone. Then she points at me and says &ldquo;You, come here. What is your name?&rdquo;. Me &ldquo;Andrew&rdquo;. She &ldquo;Who cares, from now on your name will be Bobby. You can&rsquo;t trust anyone on this ship, especially the traitors. Now, everyone point a finger at Bobby and shout TRAITOR!!!&rdquo;. A few people point their fingers and very silently and timidly start saying &ldquo;Traitor.&rdquo; At this point I was sure I will be having as much fun from this attraction as possible. I start lifting my hands in encouragement and shout &ldquo;Oh come on, you can do better!!&rdquo; Now everyone reacts a little better, still a little too much zombie like for my liking. The pirate gives me a rag and tells from now on my job is to clean the cannons and points to one of them. I start shining it off and soon enough it shoots. &ldquo;What have you done?! I told you to clean the cannon, not to shoot it!&rdquo; &ldquo;Premature detonation, it happens, it&rsquo;s not my fault!&rdquo; &ldquo;Give me back the rag!&rdquo; &ldquo;NO!!&rdquo; at this point we had a short discussion about who will keep the rag. She explains that as Bobby is the traitor he has to be tortured and puts me on the chair with a white sheet in front of me. When she asks something and strikes the hammer behind my head. I would guess that everyone else at that point was enjoying a nice splash of my brain on the front of the sheet. Then she does the same thing again. Then tells me to open my legs wide. Attractions like this are just like jumping with parachute. They are made to be safe as it&rsquo;s bad marketing when something happens to customers, but you never know that might happen *splash*. Lets just say I looked her in the eyes which said &ldquo;You better not F***ing miss,&rdquo; I might not care about my balls, but I don&rsquo;t feel like acting as a snake for the rest of the day. She hits between my legs, a cannon shoots and lets just say something happens, everyone has to abandon the ship. She takes everyone to the exit, explaining what to do. Due to my personally I choose not to stay at my current place, just get up and casually start leaving the ship. The pirate returns, notices I&rsquo;m gone, stays confused for a few seconds, then runs back to the exit and shouts &ldquo;If you will see Bobby on the shore.. Kill him!!&rdquo; Made me chuckle, my kind of girl.</p>

<p>I found a transition a little strange, but we ended in some kind of hospital or morgue or something like that. The cleaner explained that we shouldn&rsquo;t be here and it will be bad if the master found us. But as the master was away why don&rsquo;t everyone come closer so we could explore the corpse on the table. I went close enough to stick my nose in the stomach of the corpse, the rest of a group needed a few more invitations. He invited one from the group to hold the bucket and then started taking away the parts of a corpse. &ldquo;Here is the spleen.&rdquo; He pressed it and something wet hit me on the forehead. Someone from the group shouted &ldquo;Oh S<strong>t!!&rdquo; and the cleaner replied &ldquo;No S</strong>t, just piss.&rdquo; The master returned  and told us to hide in the next room which was full of corpses. After a few more scares we moved to the next room.</p>

<p>This time the theme was a trial and thought it had a few funny moments it didn&rsquo;t leave a lasting impression. The next room was some story about witches being burned and then going through a labyrinth. After the labyrinth we were at the city alley with a stake ready for burning a witch. After some talking one girl from the group was chosen and tied to a stake. Maybe not everyone understands what this is safe fun with possible consequences, but seeing the fear in the eyes of that girl about to be burned was something *take a deep breath* &hellip; Well I can&rsquo;t find the words to explain it. A big fire starts roaring, it stops after a bit and only a skeleton left on the stake. I guess you can&rsquo;t save all, time to move to the next live show.</p>

<p>We enter a room in the house and an actor tells us to sit before he could tell the story of this house. I scan the room and choose the seat by the chest as in my opinion it should provide the most fun. I wasn&rsquo;t wrong. I also do the same thing when I enter any room. Just look for a place which will be comfortable enough and would provide a best survivability chance in case some madmen came in through the door shooting/stabbing everyone in his sight. An actor tells a story about a sister killing a sister, hiding her in the basement and if you visit the house on the day she was killed you might see her ghost. As it happens today is the day of her death and then basement door starts banging. The lights go out. Now if you watch &ldquo;horror movies&rdquo; (in quotes because I have my opinion about that) just imagine the scene were it&rsquo;s pitch black, at some points in time a light(ing) flashes so you could see something scary. Fun.</p>

<p>This is the end of the attraction. Unless you&rsquo;re some sensitive person who starts running up the ceiling every time something makes a sound (scaring everyone else) I would highly suggest visiting Amsterdam Dungeon. So much fun!</p>

<p>This will make unit testing impossible. To test the code you would need to use functional tests which would require a database. Code using the database will run much longer and the longer tests run the higher the chance they won&rsquo;t be run at all.</p>

<p>For this reason in unit testing a simpler version of dependency can be used:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I won&rsquo;t remember that I did in chronological order. Will try to write about the places I visited and my thoughts about them in general.</p>

<p>As now I had museum card it was time to start visiting museums. My suggestion is to either ask your host if he has one or maybe buy it. Depending on how long you&rsquo;re staying and how much you want to visit (Amsterdam card might also work). It&rsquo;s great because if you&rsquo;re visiting a lot of places it can save you a lot. You also don&rsquo;t need to wait in general queue and most of the time can just go in (going through a special queue which rarely has any people).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/16901087803/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10448519_10202296476393877_511676680794428938_o"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8868/16901087803_ccdc32a729_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="10448519_10202296476393877_511676680794428938_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t visited it this time, but I would suggest to visit the sex museum which is near train station. The ticket is cheap and you will find a lot of funny items in there.</p>

<p>Van Gogh museum I found interesting. It can be hectic at times with people making long queues. If you just gonna enjoy the paintings themselves, read only about the ones which make you really interested and be unconventional (going opposite direction than everyone) it can be easy to navigate it. Some paintings I liked, others not so much. Even thought after seeing the paintings I think he was a good artist I don&rsquo;t really care about that. That fascinates (I knew this before visiting museum) me about Van Gogh is his choice to paint every day. This is the great reminder that if you do something every day the compounding interest will pay off in the long run. You could also see that he experimented a lot. This is a great idea to keep in the back of your mind, not just do the same thing you did hundreds of time, but to be brave and try something new. I also found his &ldquo;mental problems&rdquo; interesting and would have enjoyed to get more information about it. My recommendation for this museum &ndash; visit it.</p>

<p>Close by is the Rijksmuseum which is hard to miss. You might go by it even if you&rsquo;re not planing on visiting it. I think the toilets are in public space (as far as I remember) so it&rsquo;s an extra reason to visit it (especially for female visitors as they can&rsquo;t take a leek in the street). The museum is big. As I missed where you could get a map navigating it was a bit of a challenge trying to decide if you went down this corridor or not. It&rsquo;s split into many cultures / times / purpose blocks so you will see a lot of different things. Parts of it can be explored in a relaxing manner. Parts of it are so saturated with tourists that you just want to get away as far as possible (especially the paintings). I think the book lovers would especially like the library as at least my first thought after entering it was &ldquo;I want this room.&rdquo; At least before I remembered I&rsquo;m allergic to things. It will take a while and some legwork to visit all museum, but I enjoyed it and suggest to visit it.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17333620578/in/album-72157652211723419/" title="10448686_10202296477433903_6185703472155902306_o"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8727/17333620578_d4fbced7fa_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="10448686_10202296477433903_6185703472155902306_o"></a><script async src="http://ifdattic.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If your stay in Amsterdam is short and you need to optimize your visiting this general area is a great start. You have the Rijksmuseum with small a park (a nice place to sit down, relax and read a book). On the right side you have the Van Gogh museum. Between them is the small pool and a park and a big letter sign. On the right you also have some other museums.</p>

<p>For me I didn&rsquo;t find the diamonds museum that much interesting. That is because of my personality. I just can&rsquo;t understand the point of paying so much for some shiny, useless (then used as a jewelry) peace of stone. For me it&rsquo;s worth as much as some fake stone for a few bucks. They still look the same and as you won&rsquo;t be sawing any walls they both serve the same purpose of being useless. If you have some free time to kill you might go visit it, it wasn&rsquo;t the worst place I visited.</p>

<p>Close by you will find House of Bols, the Cocktail &amp; Genever Experience museum. Which I visited mostly because of &ldquo;learn something and get drunk, sure, why not&rdquo; (being sober wasn&rsquo;t on my plan at that point in life). I would just suggest to skip this one. It isn&rsquo;t cheap, you won&rsquo;t learn a lot and most of it feels like being in a big commercial and the drink at the end isn&rsquo;t that good (at least mine wasn&rsquo;t). Rather buy some snacks, a bottle of wine and go to Vondelpark which is close by. Have a picnic. If you would like to eat behind a table there is a street which whole focus is on food. Just can&rsquo;t remember where, but if you would walk past it you would notice as everyone is trying to get you inside. Walking away often is met with additions for free drink or some other way to sweeten the deal.</p>

<p>As my walk from the place I was staying to central streets always led through Amsterdam museum I decided to visit at some point. Not for long. I found it confusing (navigation) and requiring a lot of attention/effort. It soon looked like something I&rsquo;m not enjoying and just left. Your experience may vary.</p>

<p>In the center square is Madame Tussauds wax museum. I was trying to decide if I should visit, but in the end decided to skip it. Mostly because seeing &ldquo;From this point on you have only to wait 20 minutes.&rdquo; How about, No. Also, looking at wax sculptures of the people I don&rsquo;t care about isn&rsquo;t something I find exciting. Especially when you can see much more excitement by walking down the Red Light District which is only a couple minutes away. Close by is a church to which I went simple because I had a free pass with museum card. Also to test if I turn to ashes after going past the doors (I had my doubts). Meh, there are more interesting things to see. Quick circle around and I&rsquo;m out the doors (also don&rsquo;t want to take the chance on turning to ashes, just in case where was a lag in the system).</p>

<p>From tourist kiosks you can buy the tickets to museums/attractions. Depending on what you get it can save you at least a few euros. In my opinion it&rsquo;s worth to check out the options, especially if you know you will be visiting them. Just make sure you have all the information about the ticket. For example if you buy the ticket for Body Works you&rsquo;re allowed to use it only from 4 pm (there are other options). It only works until 6 pm so you would want to there as soon as you&rsquo;re allowed to use the ticket. I was thinking that about an hour should be enough for it so arrived a bit later. That I didn&rsquo;t take into consideration is how big it&rsquo;s and it would be so fun that I will want to read everything. Everyone would have his own definition of fun. As someone who gets hungry watching an autopsy I found this exhibition a lot of fun. You start at the sixth floor and go down until you reach the basement. Every floor has a theme, like bones, muscles, reproduction, sex, etc. The first few floors I was able to explore undisturbed. Then an employer started shadowing me blocking the doors back to the previous floor. Then she started asking if I knew they worked until 6 pm and in the end just plainly suggesting what you might want to pick up the pace. The basement contains the sex theme and if you ever wondered how the act of making love looked from inside this is your chance. I would highly suggest visiting this exhibit, but I think it would depend on how hard your stomach is.</p>

<p>You might be inclined to drive a bike around Amsterdam. I would just suggest simply walking around. In a nice weather it is relaxing. You&rsquo;re able to pay more attention to your surroundings and Amsterdam has a lot of nice places and hidden gems. Just make sure you pay attention and don&rsquo;t stand in goofing around in car/bike road.</p>

<p>During some random walks I found a few rich people houses made museums including free entry with museum card. Some have some pros to them like a nice garden. Others might have some strange things like a church in the attic. In summary it wasn&rsquo;t bad to learn how people lived before we had internet and computers and it was a way to kill some time. That I liked about visiting them is that it hardened my choice of being minimalist as all that to me looked so pointless. You might have already noticed this about me, but after returning back home I&rsquo;m almost put everything I own in the middle of the room and put it on fire. Made a compromise to send everything I don&rsquo;t need to my friends the next day.</p>

<p>The museum card also allowed me to visit a photo gallery and I was pleasantly surprised. Part of the gallery was closed and part of it just tried to sell you something. The thing I liked and was surprised by was that it was having an exhibition by Larry Clark (if you don&rsquo;t know who he is just know that it will be NSFW).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the morning it felt great to have my cup of tea in front of a fleet of ducks. I like water, it&rsquo;s relaxing. As the houseboat required maintenance we moved to hosts&#8217; house which was close to city center. It was a nice place. The only problem was that internet connection was down. For someone who requires it for working this wasn&rsquo;t good news. At least the host could hotspot his phone, but the speed of it was as exciting as counting dust falling. I could hardly check my email. After having a birthday breakfast prepared by the host I went out for a random walk around the city. My first destination was to check out NEMO science center. We saw it while taking a taxi ride and it looked interesting. It didn&rsquo;t look that interesting after I found out you have to take the stairs to the top. Was starting to think if I should even bother with it. Well, nothing is easy in life and you need to put some effort if you want something back. Climbing them wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I thought, just the first 10 steps looked terrible. You can see most of the Amsterdam from the roof and it&rsquo;s a nice place to relax (as long as you stay away from kids). I chose a quiet spot and sit down to read Psycho Cybernetics. You can&rsquo;t get the original on kindle and I chose to return without it after a trip.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/17333628968" title="10438926_10202278717309911_6209002604154581610_n by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7690/17333628968_eb54ccf813_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="10438926_10202278717309911_6209002604154581610_n"></a></p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t remember exactly which places I visited, but I took a large circle around town. I roughly guessing that during my trips I walk about 10-20 kilometers per day. Of course Amsterdam is a great city to rent a bike and explore it this way, but I don&rsquo;t see a point for that personally. For me I get tired about the same. It&rsquo;s just the question of time (bike takes a bit less) which I had enough, so I chose the transport type I like most &ndash; my legs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/16901198423" title="10269094_10202278718189933_2393730023996421613_o by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7797/16901198423_de904fbbc3_z.jpg" width="640" height="452" alt="10269094_10202278718189933_2393730023996421613_o"></a></p>

<p>After returning the host invited to join them to watch a game in a city. Unlike most people think I&rsquo;m not against the sports and if I had enough health or skills I would do them. That I don&rsquo;t understand is the point of watching a bunch of people with the ball. I can find more interesting things to do. Recently someone asked &ldquo;what things?&rdquo; and my answer was &ldquo;You&rsquo;re old enough, use your imagination.&rdquo; But sure, why not, let&rsquo;s try it, who knows maybe I will enjoy it. The game was a nice one, but I could still just watch 2 minute reel the next day and save at least an hour.</p>

<p>The tip time: <em>avoid drinking beer (or a lot of any beverage) in Netherlands</em>. Why? Because you have to pay for the toilet in bars. And no, they don&rsquo;t care that you&rsquo;re a customer. You want to piss &ndash; you pay. As they don&rsquo;t even have normal beer (meaning you can drink as much as you want and you won&rsquo;t get drunk) if you went a little overboard you could end up spending more on WC than on the drinks. Drink responsibly.</p>

<p>After a while we went to a house boat. Amsterdam is beautiful during the night. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I personally find it funny when people try to hide the usage of drugs. Like if you close yourself in the toilet and I hear *cocaine snorting sounds* like I will be thinking that you&rsquo;re cleaning the toilet. Then four of us went to a club. One high on cocaine, one on ecstasy, one on weed and one (me) had a few beers. And from that I saw, I still had the most fun (and it wasn&rsquo;t a fun night). Before entering we first had to wait until some overdosed girl was taken out. Kids, use drugs responsibly.</p>

<p>You might kind of guess it, but I&rsquo;m not a big fan of clubs. I&rsquo;m not against them or anything, it&rsquo;s just not for me. If it&rsquo;s impossible to have a normal conversation (the one were your only reply is nod then lips stop moving) then the place is too loud. Give me one person who loves to talk (I&rsquo;m better listener than talker), a cup of tea, cozy atmosphere and I will be having the best night of my life. The place was crowded, full of smoke and DJs were so terrible that I wanted to go to them and slap them in the face and just tell them to leave the Spotify playing without messing with controls. One thing I noticed is that I stopped caring about tobacco smokes. Don&rsquo;t like it, it makes me nauseating, but don&rsquo;t care and don&rsquo;t ever want to do that again. Then came 3 AM and I think I know how Cinderella must have felt when midnight came. All the better looking (from outside) ass grinders (girls that grind their asses into anything that moves or doesn&rsquo;t move) in a blink of an eye changed into some alligator monsters. Group or no group, I don&rsquo;t care, I chose not to stay a second longer in there. They looked hungry and I&rsquo;m too old to be grinded into a wall.</p>

<p>The next day I chose to go to Westerpark because it looked like a big splash of green and was close from my position. My suggestion is just to avoid it and better go to Vondelpark. Only the start of it is a real park and the rest is I think some kind off housings (haven&rsquo;t found the entry). You end up walking a side street all the way around without being able to enjoy any greenery. As my new host will be able to check-in me only in the evening we made a deal that I will leave some things at her place so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to walk with them everywhere tomorrow (knowing with how much I travel it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal). Can&rsquo;t remember the exact description but it make me happy thinking about &ldquo;go meet a girl in a red dress.&rdquo; Sometimes silly things make you smile. Went by the Anne Frank house and right away I knew that I won&rsquo;t be visiting it (especially after the host added some more info about it). No way I&rsquo;m standing in that long of a line for something I don&rsquo;t find interesting. I was invited for a cup of tea, we talked and learned about each other. One of many enjoyable conversations we had with the host. Can&rsquo;t remember that I did for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The next day after waking up and noticing that WiFi is still not available I packed my stuff and left. The host was not home, but I was not going to waste precious hours I could spend working and earning money to pay off this trip. The weather was gray and wet, not enjoyable. I chose to stop at some organic burger place with a big table in the corner (window included). You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how productive you can be after changing the scenery and with a cold beer nearby. Did all my planned work in about an hour surprising myself and my client. Too bad I was charging by an hour. Time for another tip. In Amsterdam you don&rsquo;t need to worry much if you might need WiFi for something. Some places require using some app (skip those), some have it available (you stand in the street doing what you do) and some have the password on their menu. You might need to shop around to find the WiFi you like, but you will find it somewhere if needed.</p>

<p>The new place I was staying at was a bit strange, but nice. Third floor, from one window you can see the street and canals. My room was in the attic which has a window to the inner yard. It was quiet except for birds singing (strangely I liked that). Most of the mornings I woke up with sun tickling my naked leg. The architecture I found a bit strange and hard to figure out. Every day I had to watch out not to be killed by circular stairs or low ceilings (I&rsquo;m tall). Also I find it strange that everything is small when Dutch people are tall. I think some great-great-grandfather just went &ldquo;How about we mess up with future generations and build everything small?&rdquo; The host was a very lively French girl. I enjoyed our conversations and dinners together a lot. We became friends during this trip. She found my approach to minimalism interesting. She accepted my suggestion to try it out and simplify her own life by removing material chains. I also gave her many heart attacks (which I found satisfying) as most people are not used to someone who moves around like a ghost.</p>

<p>Some of the predictions you can make:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>CallPrediction</code> or <code>shouldBeCalled()</code> &ndash; checks that method was called 1 or more times</li>
<li><code>NoCallsPrediction</code> or <code>shouldNotBeCalled()</code> &ndash; checks that method was not called</li>
<li><code>CallTimesPrediction</code> or <code>shouldBeCalledTimes($count)</code> &ndash; checks that method was called a specified number of times</li>
<li><code>CallbackPrediction</code> or <code>should($callback)</code> &ndash; checks method against custom callback</li>
</ul>


<p>Custom predictions can be created by implementing <code>PredictionInterface</code>.</p>

    <id>http://ifdattic.com/review-of-dutch-php-2015-conference</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On June of 2015 I attended the Dutch PHP conference and this is a short review of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/19264000576" title="Dutch PHP 2015 Conference by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/408/19264000576_4272fa2fa2_z.jpg" width="640" height="303" alt="Dutch PHP 2015 Conference"></a></p>

<p>The conference was at Amsterdam RAI venue which is outside city center. Organizers provided directions how to get to it from city center and it&rsquo;s not hard to find. Depending on where you&rsquo;re staying for conference it might have been easier or harder to reach it. I heard some people that they would like it closer to their hotel as they don&rsquo;t want to figure out how to use public transport or take it for 20 minutes to get to the venue. I didn&rsquo;t had a direct route from my airbnb place to the venue, but it was not a big problem for me. For someone who likes exploring places by choosing a direction and walking in it a 45 minute walk to venue is a good way to freshen up my head.</p>

<p>Venue is big and well supported by staff. Signs make it easy to find where you need to go. The staff is always available to provide you with refreshments (tea, coffee, juice, water) and clean up. Stand up tables make it easy to discuss with other people while having a refreshment and sitting desks are comfortable if you need to do some work.</p>

<p>This might be normal for Dutch people, but I don&rsquo;t think of a bunch of cold sandwiches as a normal lunch. For someone who tries to avoid carbs it&rsquo;s nerving to think how many days will be spent feeling like crap from all that bread. I guess this is my own problem for not preparing and bringing something to eat. Still, from all my experience I personally hate Dutch food, not my cuisine.</p>

<p>On first day I was attending <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14190">Introduction to Event Sourcing and CQRS</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/beausimensen">Beau D. Simensen</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/willemjanz">Willem-Jan Zijderveld</a>. Lately I&rsquo;m very into Domain Driven Design and similar ways of improving applications so this workshop gave a good introduction into CQRS. The first part of workshop was explaining all the principles. Found that trying to follow the host and do it on my own laptop wasn&rsquo;t very easy due to it going too fast and having some issues. After deciding to just follow the host found the experience much better. This allowed to focus better on that is going on rather than trying to multi-task. The second part of the workshop was doing the same things, but using Broadway library. Think the workshop was well done. It might be better if the git repository was tagged after each step, so for anyone trying to follow along if they are getting behind they could just checkout the step being currently done.</p>

<p>After the workshops anyone who wanted could attend code night. During it you could work on one of available open source projects helping to improve them. It had drinks, pizza and great people to talk &amp; work with. At the end of code night during the raffle it was possible to win some prizes. It was well organized and think the code night was a success. Watch the time lapse videos of it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShfMqa57PMM">part 1</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4d04rImZAU">part 2</a>).</p>

<p>The conference had a lot of sponsors. You could play games, pick up swag, learn about new tools in sponsor booths. At the end of the conference it was possible to win prizes through the raffle.</p>

<p>Only the second talk was delayed by 15 minutes, but otherwise all conference run like well maintained clock. All talks were on time, none went over, good amount of breaks between tasks.</p>

<p>For each time slot 5 different talks were going at the same time. For anyone interested an un-official talks were available. The talks were very well done with all/most of the problems fixed (from the talks I attended). The talks weren&rsquo;t just about PHP so you could always choose topics which interest you most (devops, testing, JavaScript, CSS, etc.).</p>

<p>The opening keynote was <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14478">Hacking Foresight from Hindsight</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/joshholmes">Josh Holmes</a>. The important point of the talk was that we shouldn&rsquo;t try to do everything ourselves and should try to find mentors who will help us grow faster professionally &amp; personally.</p>

<p>For the first talk I went to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14208">Get some hypermedia up in your API</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/victorwelling">Victor Welling</a>. During it he explained how to solve problems like documentation, versioning, visibility of your API by extending with with HAL.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a tall guy and ergonomically it&rsquo;s more comfortable to stay farther away from the screen. At that moment decided to experiment with sitting in the front rows. You don&rsquo;t need to spend all the time looking at the screen and found that I enjoyed having a closer proximity/relationship with a speaker much more than being able to see the screen all the time.</p>

<p>The second talk I chose was <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14211">Automation made simple with Ansible</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/erikaheidi">Erika Heidi</a>. I played a little with Ansible before. Repetition helps with retaining information. The talk gradually explains what is possible with Ansible and after it you should be in a good position to play around with it in your projects. After talking with Erika between talks, I think now I know how my phone feels when I plug it to charge the batteries. She is a very positive girl and talking with her you can feel your own batteries charging.</p>

<p>Had a hard choice for third talk as Mathias Verraes &amp; Matthias Noback was talking at the same slot. Chose to go to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14214">Towards Modelling Processes</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes">Mathias Verraes</a>. Talk had a simulated event storming and the main point of talk was explaining how to think in temporal model, not just structural.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/18667538394" title="DPC15 - Towards Modelling Processes by Mathias Verraes by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/256/18667538394_8203dbba5e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="DPC15 - Towards Modelling Processes by Mathias Verraes"></a></p>

<p>Was a little late for <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14219">Command Bus to Awesome Town</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/rosstuck">Ross Tuck</a> talk. The speaker was lively with enough jokes between the slides. The talk explained what is command bus &amp; why/how you might want to use one in your project.</p>

<p>During the conference I went to enough talks about event sourcing and similar topics, but going to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14226">Let&rsquo;s Write Some History!</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/willemjanz">Willem-Jan Zijderveld</a> helped me to understand a few more concepts I was missing/confused.</p>

<p>For last first day talk I chose <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14231">Journey into your Lizard Brain</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/rdohms">Rafael Dohms</a>. During it he shared a personal story, explained how developers think &amp; gave tips on how to become a better developer. One of the most important points in my opinion would be to focus on the current moment. I think conferences could have more of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; talks as I find them refreshing when mixed with technical talks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/18667539664" title="DPC15 - Journey into your Lizard Brain by Rafael Dohms by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/469/18667539664_38611826a4_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="DPC15 - Journey into your Lizard Brain by Rafael Dohms"></a></p>

<p>The Conference Social was at Akhnaton. Organizers provided directions how to get from venue to it. It was easy to find the bar and after arrival everyone received drink tokens. Received enough tokens to spend the rest of the evening with a bottle of water in my hand (might be a different experience depending on your drinking habits).</p>

<p>The day before I decided to skip the morning talk. Even thought woke up refreshed I&rsquo;m trying to learn to make a decision and keep with it (unless the situation changes).</p>

<p>For second talk I went to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14238">Hexagonal architecture &ndash; message-oriented software design</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/matthiasnoback">Matthias Noback</a>. The talk was well paced, explaining how to improve your applications by focusing on messages.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/19293946821" title="DPC15 - Hexagonal architecture - message-oriented software design by Matthias Noback by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/445/19293946821_426765221f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="DPC15 - Hexagonal architecture - message-oriented software design by Matthias Noback"></a></p>

<p>I think the composer is a wonderful tool making my life much easier. I think I know enough of it to do what is needed and advise others of best practices (like using CLI and not editing JSON file). It never hurts to make sure so I went to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14245">Composer The Right Way</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/rdohms">Rafael Dohms</a>. The talk explained some parts which you might not use so often &amp; how to use composer better. If you don&rsquo;t use composer (or know what it is) stop making your life harder!</p>

<p>For the fourth talk was thinking about going to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14248">Implement Single Sign On easily with Symfony</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Saro0h">Sarah Khalil</a>. When considered that can&rsquo;t think of anything were I would need to implement it in the near future and need to mix a less technical talk for better ratio. Went to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14249">Software architecture in an agile age</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/harrieverveer">Harrie Verveer</a>. Maybe it&rsquo;s the trauma from college when had to do a lot of UML diagrams or maybe being sleepy after lunch, but expected a little more from the talk. It was still a good talk explaining how to work better on your projects. I agree with most important idea what no matter which format you use it&rsquo;s good to make at least few notes/diagrams before you start building things.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/19284034222" title="DPC15 - Software architecture in an agile age by Harrie Verveer by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/357/19284034222_5f5d050fb2_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="DPC15 - Software architecture in an agile age by Harrie Verveer"></a></p>

<p>For last talk chose to go to <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14253">Adding 1.21 Gigawatts to Application with RabbitMQ</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/asgrim">James Titcumb</a>. The talk is very technical with code examples and at some points it can feel a little dry. We talked with a speaker about how it can be improved. The talk explains very well how to use RabbitMQ in your projects, including pitfalls to avoid.</p>

<p>The closing keynote <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/14639">Behind the Scenes of Maintaining an Open Source Project</a> was done by <a href="https://twitter.com/seldaek">Jordi Boggiano</a> about how open source project looks behind the scenes. He went through different stages of it (maintenance, anger, etc.) including anecdotes and personal stories. Staying behind the screen we often forget about the world behind our backs and that open source is only possible thanks to the community and people who spend their energy &amp; time.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the conference a lot and really happy about attending it. It&rsquo;s was nice to put Twitter/GitHub profiles with real people. Would like to thank the organizers, speakers, audience for three great days of new experiences &amp; sharing knowledge. In the end I would like to borrow (in other words steal) the quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/michellesanver">Michelle Sanver</a> which summarizes what is a conference very well &ndash; &ldquo;<em><a href="https://blog.liip.ch/archive/2015/02/10/conferences-that-are-parties-with-talks-phpbenelux-and-sunshinephp.html">A conference is a party with talks</a></em>&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of my architecture for DDD is taken from <a href="http://programmingarehard.com/">David Adams</a>, <a href="http://verraes.net/">Mathias Verraes</a>, <a href="http://williamdurand.fr/">William Durand</a> &amp; other smart people.</p>

<p>While developing an application I try to keep the code separated. I also love testing and one wonderful tool which helps me produce good quality code is <a href="http://www.phpspec.net/">phpspec</a>. The issue is what by default it keeps all the tests in the root directory.</p>

<p>phpspec requires some configuration to keep the tests where they belong. You might notice that I&rsquo;m using Symfony framework for my application. When you do DDD development the framework used isn&rsquo;t that important. My domain login is kept in <code>src/Domain</code> directory &amp; infrastructure code is kept as bundles in <code>src</code> directory.</p>

<p>The following configuration is required to make phpspec work correctly (finding specs, creating/updating specs, running specs):</p>

<p>Save the file as <code>phpspec.yml</code> in root directory.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifdattic/18485964273" title="Configure phpspec for DDD by Andrew Marcinkevičius, on Flickr"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3898/18485964273_ac0e4e5e5b_z.jpg" width="640" height="296" alt="Configure phpspec for DDD"></a></p>

<p>If you would run:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>phpspec describe Domain/User/ValueObject/UserName
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It should create a file <code>UserNameSpec.php</code> in <code>src/Domain/User/Spec/ValueObject</code>.</p>

<p>Some lines in suites might look like duplication, but I found that you have to set all the options. Otherwise there are issues with file creation/updating. You could skip <code>spec_prefix</code> option if you don&rsquo;t mind specifications directory in lowercase.</p>
